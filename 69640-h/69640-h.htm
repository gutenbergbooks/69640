<p class="center">THE LAST OF A LONG LINE.</p>


<p>Sir Roger Rockville, of Rockville, was
the last of a very long line. It extended
from the Norman Conquest to the present
century. His first known ancestor came
over with William, and must have been a
man of some mark, either of bone and sinew,
or of brain, for he obtained what the Americans
would call a prime location. As his
name does not occur in the roll of Battle
Abbey, he was, of course, not of a high Norman
extraction; but he had done enough, it
seems, in the way of knocking down Saxons,
to place himself on a considerable eminence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
in this kingdom. The centre of his domains
was conspicuous far over the country,
through a high range of rock overhanging
one of the sweetest rivers in the kingdom.
On one hand lay a vast tract of rich
marsh land, capable, as society advanced,
of being converted into meadows; and on
the other, as extensive moorlands, finely
undulating, and abounding with woods and
deer.</p>

<p>Here the original Sir Roger built his castle
on the summit of the range of rock, with
huts for his followers; and became known
directly all over the country as Sir Roger de
Rockville, or Sir Roger of the hamlet on the
Rock. Sir Roger, no doubt, was a mighty
hunter before the lord of the feudal district;
it is certain that his descendants were. For
generations they led a jolly life at Rockville,
and were always ready to exchange
the excitement of the chase for a bit of
civil war. Without that the country would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
have grown dull, and ale and venison lost
their flavour. There was no gay London
in those days, and a good brisk skirmish
with their neighbours in helm and hauberk
was the way of spending their season. It
was their parliamentary debate, and was necessary
to thin their woods. Protection and
free trade were as much the great topics of
interest as they are now, only they did not
trouble themselves so much about corn bills.
Their bills were of good steel, and their protective
measures were arrows a cloth-yard
long. Protection meant a good suit of mail,
and a castle with its duly prescribed moats,
bastions, portcullises, and donjon keep. Free
trade was a lively inroad into the neighbouring
baron’s lands, and the importation
thence of goodly herds and flocks. Foreign
cattle for home consumption was as <em>striking
an article</em> in their market as ours, only the
blows were expended on one another’s heads,
instead of the heads of foreign bullocks—that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
is, bullocks from over the Welsh or
Scotch marches, or from beyond the next
brook.</p>

<p>Thus lived the Rockvilles for ages. In
all the iron combats of those iron times they
took care to have their quota. Whether it
was Stephen against Matilda, or Richard
against his father, or John against the
barons; whether it were York or Lancaster,
Tudor or Stuart, the Rockvilles were to be
found in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</i>, and winning power and
lands. So long as it required only stalwart
frames and stout blows, no family cut a more
conspicuous figure. The Rockvilles were at
Bosworth Field. The Rockvilles fought in
Ireland under Elizabeth. The Rockvilles
were staunch defenders of the crown in the
wars of Charles I. with his parliament. The
Rockvilles even fought for James II. at the
Boyne, when three-fourths of the most loyal
of the English nobility and gentry had
deserted him in disgust and indignation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
But from that hour they had been less
conspicuous.</p>

<p>The opposition to the successful party,
that of William of Orange, of course brought
them into disgrace; and though they were
never molested on that account, they retired
to their estate, and found it convenient to
be as unobtrusive as possible. Thenceforward
you heard no more of the Rockvilles
in the national annals. They became only
of consequence in their own district. They
acted as magistrates; they served as high-sheriffs;
they were a substantial county
family, and nothing more. Education and
civilisation advanced; a wider and very
different field of action and ambition opened
upon the aristocracy of England. Our fleets
and armies abroad; our legislature at home;
law and the church, presented brilliant paths
to the ambition of those thirsting for distinction,
and the good things that follow it.
But somehow the Rockvilles did not expand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
with this expansion. So long as it required
only a figure of six feet high, broad shoulders
and a strong arm, they were a great and
conspicuous race; but when the head became
the member most in request, they
ceased to go a-head. Younger sons, it is
true, served in army and navy, and filled
the family pulpit, but they produced no
generals, no admirals, no archbishops. The
Rockvilles of Rockville were very conservative,
very exclusive, and very stereotype.
Other families grew poor, and enriched
themselves again by marrying plebeian
heiresses. New families grew up out of
plebeian blood into greatness, and intermingled
the vigour of their first earth with
the attenuated aristocratic soil. Men of
family became great lawyers, great statesmen,
great prelates, and even great poets
and philosophers. The Rockvilles remained
high, proud, bigoted, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bornés</i>.</p>

<p>The Rockvilles married Rockvilles, or their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
first cousins the Cliffvilles, simply to prevent
property going out of the family. They
kept the property together; they did not
lose an acre; and they were a fine, tall,
solemn race,—and nothing more. What
ailed them?</p>

<p>If you saw Sir Roger Rockville—for there
was an eternal Sir Roger filling his office of
high-sheriff, he had a very fine carriage, and
a very fine retinue in the most approved and
splendid of costumes;—if you saw him sitting
on the bench at quarter-sessions, he was
a tall, stately, and solemn man. If you saw
Lady Rockville shopping in her handsome
carriage, with very handsomely attired servants,
saw her at the county ball, or on the
race-stand, she was a tall, aristocratic, and
stately lady. That was in the last generation—the
present could boast no Lady Rockville.</p>

<p>Great outward respect was shown to the
Rockvilles on account of the length of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
descent, and the breadth of their acres.
They were always, when any stranger asked
about them, declared, with a serious and
important air, to be a very ancient, honourable,
and substantial family. “Oh! a great
family are the Rockvilles—a very great
family.”</p>

<p>But if you came to close quarters with the
members of this great and highly distinguished
family, you soon found yourself fundamentally
astonished. You had a sensation come
over you, as if you were trying, like Moses, to
draw water from a rock, without his delegated
power. There was a goodly outside of things
before you, but nothing came of it. You
talked, hoping to get talking in return; but
you got little more than “noes,” and “yeses,”
and “oh, indeeds!” and “reallys,” and sometimes
not even that, but a certain look of
dignity, or dignification, that was meant to
serve for all purposes. There was a sort of
resting on aristocratic oars or “sculls,” that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
were not to be too vulgarly handled. There
was a feeling impressed on you, that eight
hundred years of descent and ten thousand a
year in landed income, did not trouble themselves
with the trifling things that gave distinction
to lesser people—such as literature,
fine arts, politics, and general knowledge.
These were very well for those who had
nothing else to pride themselves on, but for
the Rockvilles—oh, certainly they were by
no means requisite!</p>

<p>In fact, you found yourselves, with a little
variation, in the predicament of Cowper’s
people—</p>

<p class="fs80">
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">“who spent their lives</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">In dropping buckets into empty wells,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And <em>growing tired</em> of drawing nothing up.”</span><br>
</p>

<p>Who has not often come across these dry
wells of society?—solemn gulfs out of which
you can pump nothing up? You know them—they
are at your elbow every day in large
and brilliant companies, and defy the best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
sucking-buckets ever invented to extract anything
from them. But the Rockvilles were
each and all of this actual description. It
was a family feature, and they seemed, if
either, rather proud of it. They must be so;
for proud they were, amazingly proud, and
they had nothing else to be proud of, except
their acres and their ancestors.</p>

<p>But the fact was, they could not help it, it
was become organic. They had acted the
justice of peace, and maintained the constitution
against upstarts and manufacturers,
signed warrants, supported the Church, and
the house of correction, committed poachers,
and then rested on the dignity of their
ancestors for so many generations, that their
sculls, brains, constitutions, and nervous
systems were all so completely moulded into
that shape, and baked in that mould, that a
Rockville would be a Rockville to the end of
time, if God and Nature would have allowed
it. But such things wear out. The American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
Indians and the Australian natives wear
out. They are not progressive: and as
Nature abhors a vacuum, she does not forget
the vacuum, wherever it may be, whether in
a hot desert or in a cold and stately Rockville,—a
very ancient, honourable, and substantial
family that lies fallow till the thinking
faculty literally dies out.</p>

<p>For several generations there had been
symptoms of decay about the Rockville
family. Not in its property; that was as
large as ever. Not in their personal stature
and physical aspect. The Rockvilles
continued, as they always had been, a tall
and not bad-looking family. But they grew
gradually less prolific. For a hundred and
fifty years past, there had seldom been more
than two, or at most, three children. There
had generally been an heir to the estate, and
another to the family pulpit, and sometimes
a daughter, married to some neighbouring
squire. But Sir Roger’s father had been an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
only child, and Sir Roger himself was an
only child. The danger of extinction to the
family, apparent as it was, had never induced
Sir Roger to marry. At the time that we
are turning our attention upon him, he had
reached the mature age of sixty. Nobody
believed that Sir Roger now would marry;
he was the last, and likely to be, of his line.</p>

<p>It is worth while here to take a glance at
Sir Roger and his estate. They exhibited a
strange contrast. The one bore all the signs
of progress, the other of a stereotyped feudality.
The estate, which in the days of the
first Sir Roger de Rockville had been half
morass and three-quarters wilderness, was
now cultivated to the pitch of British agricultural
science. The marsh lands beyond
the river were one splendid expanse of richest
meadows, yielding a rental of four solid
pounds per acre. Over hill and dale on this
side for miles, where formerly ran wild deer,
and grew wild woodlands or furze-bushes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
now lay excellent farms and hamlets, and
along the ridge of the ancient cliffs rose the
most magnificent woods. Woods, too, clothed
the steep hill-sides, and swept down to the
noble river, their very boughs hanging far out
over its clear and rapid waters. In the midst
of these fine woods stood Rockville Hall, the
family seat of the Rockvilles. It reared its
old brick walls over the towering mass of
elms, and travellers at a distance recognised
it for what it was—the mansion of an ancient
and wealthy family.</p>

<p>The progress of England in arts, science,
commerce, and manufactures, had carried Sir
Roger’s estate along with it. It was full of
active and moneyed farmers, and flourished
under modern influences. How lucky it
would have been for the Rockville family had
it done the same!</p>

<p>But amid this estate, there was Sir Roger,
solitary, and the last of the line. He had
grown well enough—there was nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
stunted about him, as far as you could see on
the surface. In stature he exceeded six feet.
His colossal elms could not boast of a more
proper relative growth. He was as large a
landlord and as tall a justice of the peace as
you could desire; but, unfortunately, after
all, he was only the shell of a man. Like
many of his veteran elms, there was a very
fine stem, only it was hollow. There was a
man just with the rather awkward deficiency
of a soul.</p>

<p>And it was no difficult task to explain,
either, how this had come about. The Rockvilles
saw plainly enough the necessity of
manuring their lands, but they scorned the
very idea of manuring their family. What!
that most ancient, honourable, and substantial
family suffer any of the common earth of
humanity to gather about its roots! The
Rockvilles were so careful of their good blood
that they never allied it to any but blood as
pure and inane as their own. Their elms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
flourished in the rotten earth of plebeian
accumulations, and their acres produced large
crops of corn from the sewage of towns and
fat sinks, but the Rockvilles themselves took
especial care that no vulgar vigour from the
real heap of ordinary human nature should
infuse a new force of intellect into their race.
The Rockvilles needed nothing: they had all
that an ancient, honourable, and substantial
family could need. The Rockvilles had no
necessity to study at school—why should
they? They did not want to get on. The
Rockvilles did not aspire to distinction for
talent in the world—why should they? They
had a large estate, and a large estate implies
large honour and respect, though the owners of
it be simply cyphers. So the Rockville soul—unused
from generation to generation—grew</p>

<p class="center fs80">
“Fine by degrees and beautifully less,”<br>
</p>

<p>till it tapered off into nothing.</p>

<p>Look at the last of a long line in the midst
of his fine estate. Tall he was, with a stoop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
in his shoulders, and a bowing of his head on
one side, as if he had been accustomed to
stand under the low boughs of his woods, and
peer after intruders. And that was precisely
the fact. His features were thin and sharp;
his nose prominent and keen in its character;
his eyes small, black, and peering like a
mole’s, or a hungry swine’s. Sir Roger was
still oracular on the bench, after consulting
his clerk, who was a good lawyer, and looked
up to by the neighbouring squires in election
matters, for he was an unswerving tory. You
never heard of a rational thing that he had
said in the whole course of his life; but that
mattered little—he was a gentleman of
solemn aspect, of stately gait, and of very
ancient family.</p>

<p>With ten thousand a year, and his rental
rising, he was still, however, a man of overwhelming
cares. What mattered a fine
estate if all the world was against him? And
Sir Roger firmly believed that he stood in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
that predicament. He had grown up to regard
the world as full of little beside upstarts,
radicals, manufacturers, and poachers. All
were banded, in his belief, against the landed
interest. It demanded all the energy of his
very small faculties to defend himself and the
landed aristocracy against them.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for his peace, a large manufacturing
town had sprung up within a couple
of miles of him. He could see its red-brick
walls, and its red-tiled roofs, and its tall,
smoke-vomiting chimneys, growing and extending
over the slopes beyond the river. It
was to him the most irritating sight in the
world; for what were all those swarming
weavers and spinners but arrant radicals, upstarts,
sworn foes of the ancient institutions
and the landed interests of England? Sir
Roger had passed through many a desperate
conflict with them for the return of members
to parliament. They brought forward men
that were utter wormwood to all his feelings,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
and they paid no more respect to him and his
friends on such occasions than they did to
the meanest creature living. Reverence for
ancient blood did not exist in that plebeian
and rapidly multiplying tribe. There were
master manufacturers there actually that
looked and talked as big as himself, and, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entre
nous</i>, talked a vast deal more cleverly. The
people talked of rights and franchises, and
freedom of speech and of conscience, in a
way that was really frightful.</p>

<p>Then they were given most inveterately to
running out in whole and everlasting crowds
on Sundays and holidays into the fields and
woods; and as there was no part of the
neighbourhood half so pleasant as the groves
and river-banks of Rockville, they came
swarming up there in crowds that were
enough to drive any man of acres frantic.</p>

<p>Unluckily there were roads all about Rockville;
foot roads, and high roads, and bridle
roads. There was a road up the river-side,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
all the way to Rockville woods; and when it
reached them, it divided like a fork, and one
foot-path led straight up a magnificent grove
of a mile long, ending close to the hall: and
another ran all along the river-side, under the
hills and branches of the wood.</p>

<p>Oh, delicious were those woods! In the
river there were islands, which were covered
in summer with the greenest grass, and the
freshest of willows, and the clearest of waters
rushed around them in the most inviting
manner imaginable. And there were numbers
of people extremely ready to accept this
delectable invitation of these waters. There
they came in fine weather, and as these
islands were only separated from the mainland
by a little and very shallow stream, it
was delightful for lovers to get across, with
laughter, and treading on stepping-stones,
and slipping off the stepping-stones up to
the ankles into the cool brook, with pretty
screams and fresh laughter, and then landing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
on those sunny, and to them, really enchanted
islands.</p>

<p>And then came fishermen: solitary fishermen,
and fishermen in rows; fishermen
lying in the flowery grass, with fragrant
meadow-sweet and honey-breathing clover
all about their ears; and fishermen standing
in file, as if they were determined to clear all
the river of fish in a day. And there were
other lovers, and troops of loiterers, and
shouting roysterers, going along under the
boughs of the wood, and following the turns
of that most companionable of rivers. And
there were boats going up and down; boats
full of young people, all holiday finery and
mirth, and boats with duck-hunters, and
others, in Sir Roger’s eyes, detestable marauders,
with guns and dogs and great
bottles of beer. In the fine grove, on summer-days,
there might be found hundreds of
people. There were pic-nic parties, fathers
and mothers, with whole families of children,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
and a grand promenade of the delighted
artizans and their wives or sweethearts.</p>

<p>In the times prior to the growth, rapid
yet steady, of the neighbouring town, Great
Castleborough, and to the simultaneous development
of the love-of-nature principle
in the Castleburghians, nothing had been
thought of all these roads. The roads were
well enough till they led to these inroads.
Then Sir Roger aroused himself. This
must be changed. The roads must be
stopped. Nothing was easier to his fancy.
His fellow justices, Sir Benjamin Bullockshed
and Squire Sheepshank, had asked
his aid to stop the like nuisances, and it
had been done at once. So Sir Roger put
up notices all about, that the roads were to
be stopped by an Order of Session, and these
notices were signed, as required by law, by
their worships of Bullockshed and Sheepshank.
But Sir Roger soon found that it
was one thing to stop a road leading from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
One-man-town to Lonely Lodge, and another
to attempt to stop those leading from Great
Castleborough to Rockville.</p>

<p>On the very first Sunday after the exhibition
of those notice-boards, there was a ferment in
the Grove of Rockville, as if all the bees in
the county were swarming there, and all the
wasps and hornets to boot. Great crowds
were collected before each of these obnoxious
placards, and the amount of curses vomited
forth against them was really shocking for
any day, but more especially for a Sunday.
Presently there was a rush at them; they
were torn down, and simultaneously pitched
into the river. There were great crowds
swarming all about Rockville all that day,
and the next, being St. Monday, with looks
so defiant, that Sir Roger more than once
contemplated sending off for the Yeomanry
Cavalry to defend his house, which he
seriously thought in danger.</p>

<p>But so far from being intimidated from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
proceeding, this demonstration only made Sir
Roger the more determined. To have so
desperate and irreverent a population coming
about his house and woods, now presented
itself in a much more formidable aspect
than ever. So, next day, not only were the
placards once more hoisted, but rewards
offered for the discovery of the offenders,
attended with all the maledictions of the
insulted majesty of the law. No notice was
taken of this; but the whole of Great Castleborough
was in a buzz and an agitation.
There were posters plastered all over the
walls of the town, four times as large as
Sir Roger’s notices, in this style:—</p>

<p>“Englishmen! Your dearest rights are
menaced! The woods of Rockville, your
ancient, rightful, and enchanting resort, are
to be closed to you. Castleburghians, the
eyes of the world are upon you. ‘Awake!
arise! or be for ever fallen!’ England
expects every man to do his duty! And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
your duty is to resist and defy the grasping
soil-lords, to seize on your ancient patrimony!”</p>

<p>“Patrimony! Ancient and rightful resort
of Rockville!” Sir Roger was astounded at
the audacity of this upstart plebeian race.
What! they actually claimed Rockville, the
heritage of a hundred successive Rockvilles,
as their own. Sir Roger determined to carry
it to the Sessions; and at the Sessions was a
magnificent muster of all his friends. There
was Sir Roger himself in the chair; and on
either hand a prodigious row of country
squirearchy. There was Sir Benjamin Bullockshed,
and Sir Thomas Tenterhook, and
all the squires—Sheepshank, Ramsbottom,
Turnbull, Otterbrook, and Swagsides. The
clerk of the Sessions read the notice for the
closing of all the foot-paths through the
woods of Rockville, and declared that this
notice had been duly, and for the required
period, publicly posted. The Castleburghians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
protested by their able lawyer, Dare Deville,
against any order for the closing of these
ancient woods—the inestimable property of
the public.</p>

<p>“Property of the public!” exclaimed Sir
Roger. “Property of the public!” echoed
the multitudinous voices of indignant Bullocksheds,
Tenterhooks, and Ramsbottoms.
“Why, sir, do you dispute the right of Sir
Roger Rockville to his own estate?”</p>

<p>“By no means,” replied the undaunted
Dare Deville; “the estate of Rockville is
unquestionably the property of the honourable
baronet, Sir Roger Rockville; but the
roads through it are as unquestionably the
property of the public.”</p>

<p>The whole bench looked at itself; that is,
at each other, in wrathful astonishment.
The swelling in the diaphragms of the squires
of Otterbrook, Turnbull, and Swagsides, and
all the rest of the worshipful row, was too
big for utterance. Only Sir Roger himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
burst forth with an abrupt—“Impudent
fellow! But I’ll see him —— first!”</p>

<p>“Grant the order!” said Sir Benjamin
Bullockshed; and the whole bench nodded
assent. The able lawyer Dare Deville retired
with a pleasant smile. He saw an agreeable
prospect of plenty of grist to his mill. Sir
Roger was rich, and so was Great Castleborough.
He rubbed his hands not in the
least like a man defeated, and thought to
himself—“Let them go at it—all right.”</p>

<p>The next day the placards on the Rockville
estate were changed for others, bearing,
“<span class="smcap">Stopped by order of Sessions!</span>” and alongside
of them were huge carefully painted
boards, denouncing on all trespassers prosecutions
according to law. The same evening
came a prodigious invasion of Castleburghians,
who tore down all the boards and placards,
and carried them on their shoulders to Great
Castleborough, singing as they went, “See
the Conquering Heroes come!” They set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
them up in the centre of the Castleborough
market-place, and burnt them along with an
effigy of Roger Rockville.</p>

<p>This was grist at once to the mill of the
able lawyer Dare Deville. He looked on and
rubbed his hands. Warrants were speedily
issued by the baronets of Bullockshed and
Tenterhook, for the apprehension of the individuals
who had been seen carrying off the
notice-boards, for larceny; and against a
number of others for trespass, and for aiding
and abetting. There was plenty of work for
Dare Deville and his brethren of the robe;
but it all ended, after the flying about of
sundry mandamuses and assize trials, in Sir
Roger finding that though Rockville was his,
the roads through it were the public’s.</p>

<p>As Sir Roger drove homewards from the
assize, which finally settled the question of
those foot-paths, he heard the bells in all the
steeples of Great Castleborough burst forth
with a grand peal of triumph. He closed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
the windows of his fine old carriage, and
sunk into a corner: but he could not drown
the intolerable sound. “But,” said he, “I’ll
stop their pic-nicing. I’ll stop their fishing.
I’ll have hold of them for trespassing and
poaching!” There was war henceforth between
Rockville and Great Castleborough.</p>

<p>On the next Sunday there came literally
thousands of the jubilant Castleburghians to
Rockville. They had brought baskets and
wine for dining and drinking success to all
foot-paths. But in the great grove there
were keepers and watchers, who warned them
to keep the path, that narrow, well-worn line
up the middle of the grove. “What! were
they not to sit on the grass?” “No.”
“What! were they not to pic-nic?” “No;
not there!”</p>

<p>The Castleburghians felt a sudden damp
on their spirits. But the river-bank! The
cry was “to the river-bank! There they
<em>would</em> pic-nic!” The crowd rushed away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
down the wood; but there they found a
whole regiment of watchers, who pointed
again to the narrow line of foot-path, and
told them not to trespass beyond it. But the
islands! They went over to the islands.
There, too, were Sir Roger’s forces, who
warned them back. There was no road
there—all found there would be trespassers,
and be duly punished.</p>

<p>The Castleburghians discovered that their
triumph was not quite so complete as they
had flattered themselves. The foot-paths
were theirs, but that was all. Their ancient
licence was at an end. If they came there,
there was no more fishing; if they came in
crowds, there was no more pic-nicing; if
they walked through the woods in numbers,
they must keep to Indian file, or they were
summoned before the county magistrates for
trespass and were soundly fined; and not
even the able Dare Deville would undertake
to defend them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>The Castleburghians were chop-fallen, but
they were angry and dogged; and they
thronged up to the village, and the front of
the hall. They filled the little inn in the
hamlet—they went by scores, and roving all
over the churchyard, read epitaphs—</p>

<p class="center fs80">
“That teach the rustic moralists to die,”<br>
</p>

<p>but don’t teach them to give up their old
indulgences very good-humouredly. They
went and sat in a row on the old churchyard-wall,
opposite to the very windows of
the irate Sir Roger. They felt themselves
beaten, and Sir Roger felt himself beaten.
True, he could coerce them to the foot-path—but,
then, they had the foot-paths: yet, on
the other hand, the pic-nicing, and the
fishing, and the islands! The Castleburghians
were full of sullen wrath, and Sir Roger
was—oh, most expressive old Saxon phrase—<span class="smcap">Hairsore</span>!
Yes, he was one universal
wound of vexation and jealousy of his rights.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
Every hair in his body was like a pin sticking
in him. Come within a dozen yards
of him; nay, at the most, blow on him, and
he was excruciated—you rubbed his sensitive
hairs at a furlong’s distance.</p>

<p>The next Sunday the people found the
churchyard locked up, except during service,
when beadles walked there, and desired them
not to loiter and disturb the congregation,
closing the gates and showing them out
like a flock of sheep the moment the service
was over. This was fuel to the already
boiling blood of Castleborough. The week
following, what was their astonishment to
find the much frequented, the charming
little rustic inn gone. It was actually gone!
not a trace of it; but the spot where it had
stood for ages, turfed, planted with young
spruce trees, and fenced off with post and
rail. The exasperated people now launched
forth an immensity of fulminations against
the churl, Sir Roger; and a certain number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
of them resolved to come and seat themselves
in the street of the hamlet and there
dine; but a terrific thunderstorm, which
seemed in league with Sir Roger, soon
routed them, drenched them through, and
on attempting to seek shelter in the cottages,
the poor people said they were very sorry,
but it was as much as their holdings were
worth, and they dare not admit them.</p>

<p>Sir Roger had triumphed! It was all
over with the old delightful days at Rockville.
There was an end of pic-nicing, of
fishing, of roving in the islands. One sturdy
disciple of Izaak Walton, indeed, dared to
fling a line from the banks of Rockville
Grove, but Sir Roger himself came upon him,
and endeavoured to seize him. The man
coolly walked into the middle of the river,
and without a word continued his fishing.</p>

<p>“Get out there!” exclaimed Sir Roger,
“that is still on my property.” The man
waded through the river to the other bank,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
where he knew that the land was rented by
a farmer. “Give over!” shouted Sir Roger.
“I tell you the water is mine!”</p>

<p>“Then,” said the fellow, “bottle it up,
and be-hanged to you! Don’t you see it is
all running away to Castleborough?”</p>

<p>The story was carried by the man to the
town, and occasioned a good laugh, and
many a time when Sir Roger appeared in the
place, he was greeted with—“Why don’t you
bottle up the Trent?” But the joke did
not compensate for a tittle of what was lost:
there was bad blood between Rockville and
Castleborough as a settled condition. Castleborough
was incensed, and Sir Roger was
hairsore.</p>

<p>A new nuisance sprang up. The people
of Castleborough looked on the cottagers of
Rockville as sunk in the deepest darkness
under Sir Roger, and his cousin the vicar,
who had seconded, and it was believed had
instigated the baronet to a great portion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
these proceedings. They could not pic-nic,
but they thought they could hold a camp-meeting.
They could not fish for roach, but
they thought they might for souls. Accordingly,
there assembled crowds of Castleburghians
on the green of Rockville, with a
chair and a table, and a preacher with his
head bound in a red handkerchief; and soon
there was a sound of hymns, and a zealous
call to come out of the darkness of Babylon.
But this was more than Sir Roger could
bear; he rushed forth with all his servants,
keepers, and cottagers, overthrew the table,
and routing the assembly, chased them to
the boundary of his estate.</p>

<p>The discomfited Castleburghians now fulminated
awful judgments on the unhappy
Sir Roger, as a persecutor and malignant.
They dared not enter again on his park, but
they came to the very verge of it, and held
weekly meetings on the highway, in which
they sang and declaimed as loudly as possible,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
that the winds might bear their voices to Sir
Roger’s ears.</p>

<p>To such a condition was now reduced the
last of the long line of Rockville. The spirit
of a policeman had taken possession of him;
he had keepers and watchers out on all sides,
but that did not satisfy him. He was perpetually
haunted with the idea that poachers
were after his game; that trespassers were
in his woods. His whole life was now spent
in strolling to and fro in his fields and plantations,
and in prowling along his river-side.
He looked under hedges, and watched for
long hours under forest trees. If any one
had a curiosity to see Sir Roger, they had
only to enter his fields by the wood side,
and wander a few yards from the path, and
he was almost sure to spring out over the
hedge, and in hurried and angry, almost
stammering tones, demand their name and
address. The descendant of the chivalrous
and steel-clad De Rockvilles was sunk into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
a restless spy on his own ample property.
There was but one idea in his mind—encroachment.
It was destitute of all other
furniture but the musty technicalities of
warrants and commitments. There was a
stealthy and skulking manner in everything
he did. He went to church on Sunday, but
it was no longer by the grand iron-gate
opposite to his house,—that stood generally
with a large spider’s web woven over the
lock, and several others in the corners of the
fine iron tracery, bearing evidence of the
long period since it had been opened. How
different to the time when Sir Roger and
Lady Rockville had had these gates thrown
wide on Sunday morning, and with all their
train of household servants at their back,
with true antique dignity, marched, with
much proud humility, into the house of God.
Now, Sir Roger—the solitary, suspicious, undignified
Sir Roger, the keeper and policeman
of his own property—stole in at a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
side-gate from his paddock, and back the
same way, wondering all the time whether
there was not somebody in his pheasant
preserves, or Sunday trespassers in his
grove.</p>

<p>If you entered his house, it gave you as
cheerless a feeling as its owner. There was
a conservatory, so splendid with rich plants
and flowers in his mother’s time, now a dusty
receptacle of hampers, broken hand-glasses
and garden tools. These tools could never
be used, for the gardens had grown wild.
Tall grass grew in the walks, and the huge
unpruned shrubs disputed the passage with
you. In the wood above the gardens,
reached by several flights of fine, but now
moss-grown steps, there stood a pavilion,
which had once clearly been very beautiful.
It was now damp and ruinous—its walls
covered with greenness and crawling insects.
It was a great lurking place of Sir Roger,
when on the watch for poachers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>The line of the Rockvilles was evidently
running fast out. It had reached the extremity
of imbecility and contempt—it must
soon reach its close.</p>

<p>Sir Roger used to make his regular annual
visit to town; but of late, when there he had
wandered restlessly about the streets peeping
into the shop-windows: and if it rained, he
would stand under an entry for hours, waiting
till it was gone over, rather than take a
cab or omnibus. The habit of lurking and
peering about was become fixed, and his feet
bore him instinctively into those narrow and
crowded alleys where swarm the poachers of
the city—the trespassers and anglers in the
game preserves and streams of humanity.
He had lost all pleasure in his club; the
most exciting themes of political life retained
no piquancy for him. His old friends ceased
to find any pleasure in him. He was become
the driest of all dry wells. Poachers, and
anglers, and Methodists, haunted the wretched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
purlieus of his fast fading-out mind, and he
resolved to go to town no more. His whole
nature was centred in his woods. He was
for ever on the watch; and when at Rockville
again, if he heard a door clap when in
bed, he thought it a gun in his woods; and
was up and out with his keepers.</p>

<p>Of what value was that magnificent estate
to him? those superb woods; those finely-hanging
cliffs; that clear and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">riante</i> river,
careering, travelling on, and taking a noble
sweep below his window; that glorious expanse
of most verdant meadows, stretching
almost to Castleborough, and enlivened by
numerous herds of the most beautiful cattle;
those old farms and shady lanes overhung
with hazel and wild rose; the glittering
brook, and the songs of woodland birds—what
were they to that worn-out old man,
that victim to the delusive doctrine of
blood, that man-trap, of an hereditary
name?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>There the poet could come and feel the
presence of divinity in that noble scene, and
hear sublime whispers in the trees, and create
new heavens and new earths from the glorious
charms of nature around him, and in
one short hour live an empyrean of celestial
life and love. There could come the very
humblest children of the plebeian town, and
feel a thrill of exquisite delight pervade their
bosoms at the sight of the very flowers on
the sod, and see heaven in the infinite blue
above them. And poor Sir Roger, the
holder, but not the possessor of all, walked
only in a region of sterility, with no sublimer
ideas than poachers and trespassers—no more
rational enjoyment than the brute indulgence
of hunting like a ferret, and seizing his
fellow-men like a bulldog. He was a
specimen of human nature degenerated;
retrograded from the divine to the
bestial, through the long-operating influences
of false notions, and institutions continued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
beyond their time. He had only
the soul of a keeper. Had he been
only a keeper he had been a much happier
man.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">THE FIRST OF A NEW LINE.</p>


<p>In Great Castleborough there lived a race
of paupers. From the year of the 42nd of
Elizabeth, or 1601, down to the present
generation, this race maintained an uninterrupted
descent. Like that of many a more
worldly-favoured race, theirs was a descent;
it had nothing of an ascent in it. But that is
the fate of ancestry. A man on some particular
occasion ascends; makes himself a mark
in his time; perhaps a name in the world’s
annals, and from him his family <em>descends</em>.</p>

<p>The expression is perfectly correct; as the
heralds truly have it; it descends, fades out,
and is gone. It has lived? no, continued, a
thousand years perhaps; it has descended,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
and prided itself on descending. That was
the case of the Rockvilles; and when we
hear of families and persons illustriously or
honourably descended, we hear an internal
echo which says, “Yes—descended.” The
truly great man <em>ascends</em> from his ancestors.</p>

<p>There was a steady and unbroken line of
paupers in Great Castleborough, as the parish
books testify. No families had a more unquestionable
pedigree. There was no flaw,
no dubious spot in it. The parish books were
the red-books of this race. No genealogy
could bear a more rigid scrutiny than theirs.
From generation to generation their demands
on the parish funds stand recorded. There
were no <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lacunæ</i> in their career; there was no
occasion for the herald to skip skilfully from
cousin to doubtful cousin, nor great lawyers to
cast a costly glamour over some delicate
question of legitimacy. There never failed a
rightful heir to their families. Fed on the
bread of idleness and legal provision, these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
people flourished, increased, and multiplied.
Sometimes required to work for the weekly
stipend which they received, they never acquired
a taste for labour, or lost the taste for
the bread for which they did not labour.
These paupers regarded their maintenance by
no means as a disgrace. They claimed it as
a right—as their patrimony. They contended
that one-third of the property of the Church
had been given by benevolent individuals for
the support of the poor, and that what the
Reformation wrongfully deprived them of, the
great enactment of Elizabeth rightfully—and
only rightfully—restored.</p>

<p>Those who imagine that all paupers merely
claim parish relief because the law has ordained
it, commit a great error. There were
numbers then who were hereditary paupers,
on a higher principle even than hereditary
peers, and that on a tradition carefully handed
down, that they were only manfully claiming
their own. They traced their claims from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
the most ancient feudal times. They were
none of your modern manufactures, the offspring
of wretched political necessities. They
came down from times when the lord was as
much bound to maintain his villein in gross,
as the villein was to work for the lord. These
paupers were in fact, or claimed to be, the
original <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">adscripti glebæ</i>, and to have as sound
a claim to parish support as the landed proprietor
had to his land. For this reason, in
the old Catholic times, after they had escaped
from villenage by running away from their
hundred, and remaining absent for a year
and a day, dwelling for that period in a
walled town, these people were amongst the
most diligent attendants at the abbey doors,
and, when the abbeys were dissolved, were,
no doubt, amongst the most daring of those
thieves, vagabonds, and sturdy rogues who,
after the Robin Hood fashion, beset the highways
and solitary farms of England, and
claimed their black-mail in a very unceremonious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
style. It was out of this class that
Henry VIII. hanged his seventy-two thousand
during his reign, and, as it is said, without
appearing materially to diminish their
number.</p>

<p>That they continued to “increase, multiply,
and replenish the earth,” overflowing all
bounds, overpowering by mere populousness
all the severe laws against them, of whipping,
burning in the hand, in the forehead, or the
breast, and hanging, and filling the whole
country with alarm, is evidenced by the very
Act of Elizabeth itself.</p>

<p>Amongst these hereditary paupers who, as
we have said, were found in Castleborough,
there was a family of the name of Deg. This
family had never failed to demand and enjoy
what it held to be its share of its ancient
inheritance. It appeared from the parish
records, that they practised, in different
periods, the crafts of shoemaking, tailoring,
and chimney-sweeping; but since the invention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
of the stocking-frame they had, one
and all of them, followed the profession of
stocking-weavers; or, as they were there
called, stockingers. This was a trade which
required no extreme exertion of the physical
or intellectual powers. To sit in a frame,
and throw the arms to and fro, was a thing
that might be carried to a degree of extreme
diligence, or be let down into a mere apology
for idleness. An “idle stockinger” was then
no very uncommon phrase, and the Degs
were always classed under that head. Nothing
could be more admirably adapted than
this trade for building a plan of parish relief
upon. The Degs did not pretend to be absolutely
without work, or the parish authorities
would soon have set them to some real labour—a
thing that they particularly recoiled
from, having a very old adage in the family,
that “hard work was enough to kill a man.”</p>

<p>There was, indeed, an anecdote of three of
the Degs which was continually quoted as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
exemplifying the three degrees of extreme
indolence. According to this, three Degs
were lying one fine autumn day under a
neighbour’s pear-tree. One of them, in a
languid tone, said, “There! a pear has
dropped.” The second observed, still more
languidly, “I wish I had it.” The third was
too lazy even to open his mouth to express
such a wish, much less to move and get it.</p>

<p>The Degs, then, were seldom out of work;
but they did not get enough, or do enough,
to meet and tie. They had but little work if
times were bad, and if times were good, they
complained of large families and sickly wives
and children. Be times what they would,
therefore, the Degs were due and successful
attendants at the parish pay-table. Nay, so
much was this a matter of course, that they
came at length not even to trouble themselves
to receive their pay, but sent their young
children for it; and it was duly paid. Did
any parish officer, indeed, turn restive, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
decline to pay a Deg, he soon found himself
summoned before a magistrate, and such
pleas of sickness, want of work, and poor
earnings brought forward, that he most likely
got a sharp rebuke from the benevolent but
uninquiring magistrate, and acquired a character
of hard-heartedness that stuck to him.</p>

<p>So parish overseers learnt to let the Degs
alone; and their children, thus regularly
brought up to receive the parish money for
their parents, were impatient, as they grew
up, to receive it for themselves. Marriages
in the Deg family were, consequently, very
early, and there were plenty of instances of
married Degs claiming parish relief under the
age of twenty, on the plea of being the parents
of two children. One such precocious individual
being asked by a rather verdant officer
why he was married before he was able to
maintain a family, replied, in much astonishment,
that he had married in order to maintain
himself by parish assistance. That he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
had never been able to maintain himself by
his labour, nor ever expected to do it: his
only hope, therefore, lay in marrying, and
becoming the father of two children, to which
patriarchal rank he had now attained, and
demanded his “pay.”</p>

<p>Thus had lived and flourished the Degs on
their ancient patrimony, the parish, for upwards
of two hundred years. Nay, we have
no doubt whatever that, if it could have been
traced, they had enjoyed an ancestry of
paupers as long as the pedigree of Sir Roger
Rockville himself. In the days of the most
perfect villenage they had, doubtless, eaten
the bread of idleness, and claimed it as a
right. They were numerous, improvident,
ragged in dress, and fond of an alehouse and
gossip. Like the blood of Sir Roger, their
blood had become peculiar through a long
persistence of the same circumstances. It
was become pure pauper blood.</p>

<p>The Degs married, if not entirely amongst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
Degs, yet amongst the same class. None but
a pauper would dream of marrying a Deg,
even were she handsome as Helen of Troy.
The Degs, therefore, were in constitution, in
mind, in habit, and in inclination, paupers.
But a pure and unmixed class of this kind
does not die out like an aristocratic stereotype.
It increases and multiplies. The
lower the grade, the more prolific, as is sometimes
seen on a large and even national scale.
The Degs threatened, therefore, to become a
most formidable clan in the lower purlieus of
Castleborough; but, luckily, there is so much
virtue even in evils, that one not rarely cures
another. War, the great evil, cleared the
town of Degs.</p>

<p>Fond of idleness, of indulgence, of money
easily got and as easily spent, the Degs were
rapidly drained off by recruiting parties
during the great French war. The young
men enlisted, and were marched away; the
young women married soldiers that were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
quartered in the town from time to time,
and marched away with them. There were
eventually none of the once numerous Degs
left, except a few old people, whom death
was sure to draft off at no distant period
into his regiment of the line which has no
end. Parish overseers, magistrates, and
master manufacturers felicitated themselves
on this unhoped-for deliverance from the
ancient family of the Degs.</p>

<p>But one cold, clear winter evening, the
east wind piping his sharp, sibilant ditty in
the hawthorn hedges, and poking his sharp
fingers into the sides of well broad-clothed
men by way of passing joke, Mr. Spires, a
great manufacturer of Castleborough, driving
in his gig some seven miles from the town,
passed a poor woman with a stout child on
her back. The large ruddy-looking man in
the prime of life, and in the greatcoat and
thick worsted gloves of a wealthy traveller,
cast a glance at the wretched creature trudging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
heavily on, expecting a pitiful appeal to
his sensibilities, and thinking it a bore to
have to pull off a glove, and dive into his
pocket for a copper; but to his surprise,
there was no demand, only a low curtsey,
and the glimpse of a face of singular honesty
of expression, and of excessive weariness.</p>

<p>Spires was a man of warm feelings; he
looked earnestly at the woman, and thought
he had never seen such a picture of fatigue
in his life. He pulled up and said,</p>

<p>“You seem very tired, my good woman.”</p>

<p>“Awfully tired, sir.”</p>

<p>“And are you going far to-night?”</p>

<p>“To Great Castleborough, sir, if God give
me strength.”</p>

<p>“To Castleborough!” exclaimed Mr. Spires,
“why you seem ready to drop; you’ll never
reach it. You’d better stop at the next
village.”</p>

<p>“Ay, sir, it is easy stopping for those who
have money.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>“And you’ve none, eh?”</p>

<p>“As God lives, sir, I’ve a sixpence, and
that’s all.”</p>

<p>Mr. Spires put his hand in his pocket and
held out to her the next instant half-a-crown.</p>

<p>“There, stop, poor thing—make yourself
comfortable—it’s quite out of the question
to reach Castleborough. But stay, are your
friends living in Castleborough? What are
you?”</p>

<p>“A poor soldier’s widow, sir: and may
God Almighty bless you,” said the poor
woman, taking the money, the tears standing
in her large brown eyes as she curtseyed
very low.</p>

<p>“A soldier’s widow,” said Mr. Spires. She
had touched the softest place in the manufacturer’s
heart, for he was a very loyal man,
and vehement champion of his country’s
honour in the war. “So young,” said he,—“how
did you lose your husband?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>“He fell, sir,” said the poor woman,—but
she could get no further; she suddenly
caught up the corner of her grey cloak,
covered her face with it, and burst into an
excess of grief.</p>

<p>The manufacturer felt as if he had hit the
woman a blow by his careless question. He
sat watching her for a moment in silence,
and then said—“Come, get into the gig,
my poor woman; come, I must see you to
Castleborough.”</p>

<p>The poor woman dried her tears, and
heavily climbed into the gig, expressing her
gratitude in a very touching and modest
manner. Spires buttoned the apron over
her, and taking a look at the child, said in
a cheerful tone to comfort her, “Bless me,
but that is a fine, thumping fellow, though.
I don’t wonder you are tired, carrying such a
load.”</p>

<p>The poor woman pressed the stout child,
apparently two years old, to her heart, as if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
she felt it a great blessing, and no load. The
gig drove rapidly on.</p>

<p>Presently, Mr. Spires resumed his conversation.</p>

<p>“So you are from Castleborough?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, my husband was.”</p>

<p>“So: what was his name?”</p>

<p>“John Deg, sir.”</p>

<p>“Deg?” said Mr. Spires; “Deg, did you
say?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>The manufacturer seemed to hitch himself
off towards his own side of the gig, gave
another look at her, and was silent. The
poor woman seemed somewhat astonished at
his look and movement, and was silent too.</p>

<p>After awhile Mr. Spires said again, “And
do you hope to find friends in Castleborough?
Had you none where you came from?”</p>

<p>“None, sir; none in the world!” said the
poor woman, and again her feelings seemed
too strong for her. At length she added,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
“I was in service, sir, at Poole, in Dorsetshire,
when I married; my mother only was
living, and while I was away with my husband,
she died. When—when the news
came from abroad, that—when I was a
widow, sir, I went back to my native place,
and the parish-officers said I must go to my
husband’s parish lest I and my child should
become troublesome.”</p>

<p>“You asked relief of them?”</p>

<p>“Never! oh, God knows, no, never! My
family have never asked a penny of a parish,—they
would die first, and so would I, sir;
but they said I might do it, and I had better
go to my husband’s parish at once and they
offered me money to go.”</p>

<p>“And you took it, of course.”</p>

<p>“No, sir; I had a little money, which I
had earned by washing and laundering; and
I sold most of my things, as I could not carry
them, and came off. I felt hurt, sir; my
heart rose against the treatment of the parish,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
and I thought I should be better amongst
my husband’s friends,—and my child would,
if anything happened to me. I had no
friends of my own.”</p>

<p>Mr. Spires looked at the woman in silence.</p>

<p>“Did your husband tell you anything of
his friends? What sort of a man was
he?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he was a gay young fellow, rather,
sir; but not bad to me. He always said his
friends were well off in Castleborough.”</p>

<p>“He did!” said the manufacturer, with a
great stare, and as if bolting the words from
his heart in a large gust of wonder.</p>

<p>The poor woman again looked at him with
a strange look. The manufacturer whistled
to himself, and giving his horse a smart cut
with the whip, drove on faster than ever.
The night was fast settling down; it was
numbing cold; a grey fog rose from the
river as they thundered over the old bridge;
and tall engine chimneys, and black smoky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
houses loomed through the dusk before them.
They were at Castleborough.</p>

<p>As they slackened their pace up a hill at
the entrance of the town, Mr. Spires again
opened his mouth.</p>

<p>“I should be very sorry to hurt your
feelings, Mrs. Deg,” he said, “but I have my
fears that you are coming to this place with
false expectations. I fear your husband did
not give you the truest possible account of
his family here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sir! What—what is it?” exclaimed
the poor woman; “in God’s name, tell me!”</p>

<p>“Why, nothing more than this,” said the
manufacturer; “there are few of the Degs
left here. They are old, and on the parish,
and can do nothing for you.”</p>

<p>The poor woman gave a deep sigh, and
was silent.</p>

<p>“But don’t be cast down,” said Mr. Spires.
He would not tell her what a pauper family
it really was; for he saw that she was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
very feeling woman, and he thought that she
would learn that soon enough. He felt that
her husband had from vanity given her a
false account of his connections; and he was
really sorry for her.</p>

<p>“Don’t be cast down!” he went on; “you
can wash and iron, you say; you are young
and strong; those are your friends. Depend
on them, and they will be better to you than
any other.”</p>

<p>The poor woman was silent, leaning her
head down on her slumbering child, and
crying to herself; and thus they drove on
through many long and narrow streets, with
lights glaring from the shops, but with few
people in the streets, and those hurrying
shivering along the pavement, so intense was
the cold. Anon, they stopped at a large
pair of gates; and the manufacturer rang a
bell, which he could reach from his gig; and
the gates were presently flung open, and they
drove into a spacious yard, with a large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
handsome house, having a bright lamp burning
before it, on one side of the yard, and tall
warehouses on the other.</p>

<p>“Show this poor woman and her child to
Mrs. Craddock’s, James,” said Mr. Spires,
“and tell Mrs. Craddock to make them very
comfortable; and if you will come to my
warehouse to-morrow,” added he, addressing
the poor woman, “perhaps I can be of some
use to you.”</p>

<p>The poor woman poured out her heartfelt
thanks, and following the old man-servant,
soon disappeared, hobbling over the pebbly
pavement with her living load, her limbs
stiffened almost to stone by her fatigue and
cold ride.</p>

<p>We must not pursue too minutely our
narrative. Mrs. Deg was engaged to do the
washing and getting up of Mr. Spires’s linen,
and the manner in which she executed her
task, insured her recommendations to all
their friends. Mrs. Deg was at once in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
full employ. She occupied a neat house in
a yard near the meadows below the town,
and in these meadows she might be seen
spreading out her clothes to whiten on the
grass attended by her stout little boy. In
the same yard lived a shoemaker, who had
two or three children of almost the same age
as Mrs. Deg’s child. The children, as time
went on, became playfellows. Little Simon
might be said to have the free run of the
shoemaker’s house, and he was the more
attracted thither by the shoemaker’s birds,
and his flute, on which he often played when
his work was done.</p>

<p>Mrs. Deg took a great liking to the shoemaker:
and he and his wife, a quiet, kind-hearted
woman, were almost all the acquaintances
that she cultivated. She had found
out her husband’s parents; but they were
not of a description that at all pleased her.
They were old and infirm, but they were of
the true pauper breed, a sort of persons whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
Mrs. Deg had been taught to avoid and to
despise. They looked on her as a sort of
second parish, and insisted that she should
come and live with them, and help to
maintain them out of her earnings. But
Mrs. Deg would rather that her little boy
had died than have been familiarised with
the spirit of these old people. Despise them
she struggled hard not to do, and she agreed
to allow them sufficient to maintain them, on
condition that they desisted from any further
application to the parish. It would be a
long and disgusting tale to recount all the
troubles, annoyances, and querulous complaints
and even bitter accusations that she
received from her connections, whom she could
never satisfy; but she considered it one of
her crosses in life, and patiently bore it,
seeing that they suffered no real want, so
long as they lived, which was for years; but
she would never allow her little Simon to be
with them alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>The shoemaker neighbour was a stout protector
to her against the greedy demands of
the old people, and of others of the old Degs,
and also against another class of inconvenient
visitors, namely suitors, who saw in Mrs.
Deg a neat and comely young woman, with
a flourishing business, and a neat and well-furnished
house, a very desirable acquisition.
But Mrs. Deg had resolved never again
to marry, but to live for the boy, and
she kept her resolve with firmness and
gentleness.</p>

<p>The shoemaker often took walks in the
extensive town-meadows, to gather groundsel
and plantain for his canaries and gorse-linnets,
and little Simon Deg delighted to
accompany him with his own children.
There William Watson, the shoemaker, used
to point out to the children the beauty of the
flowers, the insects, and other objects of
nature; and while he sat on a stile and read
in a little old book of poetry, as he often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
used to do, the children sate on the summer
grass, and enjoyed themselves in a variety
of plays.</p>

<p>The effect of these walks, and the shoemaker’s
conversation on little Simon Deg, was
such as never wore out of him through his
whole life, and soon led him to astonish the
shoemaker by his extraordinary conduct.
He manifested the greatest uneasiness at
their treading on the flowers in the grass;
he would burst into tears if they persisted in
it; and when asked why, he said they were
so beautiful, and that they must enjoy the
sunshine, and be very unhappy to die. The
shoemaker was amazed, but indulged the
lad’s fancy. One day he thought to give
him a great treat, and when they were out in
the meadows, he drew from under his coat a
bow and arrow, and shot the arrow high up
into the air. He expected to see him in
an ecstasy of delight; his own children
clapped their hands in transport, but Simon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
stood silent, and as if awestruck. “Shall I
send up another?” asked the shoemaker.</p>

<p>“No, no!” exclaimed the child, imploringly.
“You say God lives up there, and
He mayn’t like it.”</p>

<p>The shoemaker laughed, but presently he
said, as if to himself, “There is too much
imagination there. There will be a poet
there if we don’t take care.”</p>

<p>The shoemaker offered to teach Simon to
read, and to solidify his mind, as he termed
it, by arithmetic, and then to teach him to
work at his trade. His mother was very
glad; and thought shoemaking would be a
good trade for the boy; and that with Mr.
Watson she should have him always near
her. He was growing now a great lad, and
was especially strong, and of a frank and
daring habit. He was greatly indignant
at any act of oppression of the weak
by the strong, and not seldom got into
trouble by his championship of the injured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
in such cases amongst the boys in the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>He was now about twelve years of age;
when going one day with a basket of clothes
on his head to Mr. Spires’ for his mother,
he was noticed by Mr. Spires himself from
his counting-house window. The great war
was raging; there was much distress
amongst the manufacturers; the people were
suffering, and exasperated against their
masters. Mr. Spires, as a staunch tory,
and supporter of the war, Was particularly
obnoxious to the workpeople, who uttered
violent threats against him. For this reason
his premises were strictly guarded, and at the
entrance of his yard, just within the gates, was
chained a large and fierce mastiff, his chain
allowing him to approach near enough to
intimidate any stranger, though not to reach
him. The dog knew the people who came
regularly about, and seemed not to notice
them; but on the entrance of a stranger, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
rose up, barked, and came to the length of
his chain. This always drew the attention
of the porter, if he was away from his box,
and few persons dared to pass till he came.</p>

<p>Simon Deg was advancing with the basket
of clean linen on his head, when the dog
rushed out, and barking loudly, came exactly
opposite to him, within a few feet. The
boy, a good deal startled at first, drew
himself back against the wall, but at a
glance perceiving that the dog was at the
length of his tether, he seemed to enjoy his
situation, and stood smiling at the furious
animal, and lifting his basket with both
hands above his head, nodded to him, as if
to say—“Well, old boy, you’d like to eat me,
wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>Mr. Spires, who sat near his counting-house
window at his books, was struck
with the bold and handsome bearing of
the boy, and said to a clerk, “What boy is
that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p>“It is Jenny Deg’s,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Ha! that boy! Zounds! how boys do
grow! Why, that’s the child that Jenny
Deg was carrying when she came to Castleborough,
and what a strong, handsome,
bright-looking fellow he is now.”</p>

<p>As the boy was returning, Mr. Spires
called him to the counting-house door, and
put some questions to him as to what he was
doing and learning, and so on. Simon,
taking off his cap with much respect, answered
in such a clear and modest way, with
a voice which had so much feeling and natural
music in it, that the worthy manufacturer
was greatly taken with him.</p>

<p>“That’s no Deg!” said he, when he again
entered the counting-house, “not a bit of it.
He’s all Goodrich, or whatever his mother’s
name was, every inch of him.”</p>

<p>The consequence of that interview was,
that Simon Deg was very soon after perched
on a stool in Mr. Spires’ counting-house,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
where he continued till he was twenty-two.
Mr. Spires had no son, only a single daughter;
and such were Simon Deg’s talents, attention
to business, and genial disposition, that at
that age Mr. Spires gave him a share in the
concern. He was himself now getting less
fond of exertion than he had been, and placed
the most implicit reliance on Simon’s judgment
and general management. Yet, no
two men could be more unlike in their
opinions beyond the circle of trade. Mr.
Spires was a staunch tory of the staunch old
school. He was for church and king, and
for things remaining for ever as they had
been. Simon, on the other hand, had liberal
and reforming notions. He was for the improvement
of the people, and their admission
to many privileges. Mr. Spires, therefore,
was liked by the leading men of the place,
and disliked by the people. Simon’s estimation
was precisely in the opposite direction.
But this did not disturb their friendship; it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
required another disturbing cause, and that
came.</p>

<p>Simon Deg and the daughter of Mr. Spires
grew attached to each other; and as the
father had thought Simon worthy of becoming
a partner in the business, neither of the young
people deemed that he could object to a
partnership of a more domestic description.
But here they made a tremendous mistake.
No sooner was such a proposal hinted
at, than Mr. Spires burst forth with the fury
of all the winds from the bag of Ulysses.</p>

<p>“What! a Deg aspire to the hand of
the sole heiress of the enormously opulent
Spires?”</p>

<p>The very thought almost cut the proud
manufacturer off with apoplexy. The ghosts
of a thousand paupers rose up before him,
and he was black in the face. It was
only by a prompt and bold application of
leeches and lancet, that the life of the great
man was saved. But there was an end of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
further friendship between himself and the
expectant Simon. He insisted that he should
withdraw from the concern, and it was done.
Simon, who felt his own dignity deeply
wounded too, for dignity he had, though the
last of a long line of paupers—his own
dignity, not his ancestors’—took silently, yet
not unrespectfully, his share—a good round
sum, and entered another house of business.</p>

<p>For several years there appeared to be a
feud, and a bitterness between the former
friends; yet, it showed itself in no other
manner, than by a careful avoidance of each
other. The continental war came to an end;
the manufacturing distress increased exceedingly.
Then came troublous times, and a
fierce warfare of politics. Great Castleborough
was torn asunder by rival parties. On
one side stood pre-eminent, Mr. Spires; on
the other towered conspicuously, Simon Deg.
Simon was growing rich, and was extremely
popular. He was on all occasions the advocate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
of the people. He said that he had sprung
from, and was one of them. He had bought
a large tract of land on one side of the town;
and intensely fond of the country and flowers
himself, he had divided this into gardens,
built little summer-houses in them, and let
them to the artizans. In his factory, he had
introduced order, cleanliness, and ventilation.
He had set up a school for the children,
besides an evening and Sunday school for
such as had begun to work in the factory or
the loom, with a reading-room and conversation-room
for the workpeople, and encouraged
them to bring their families there, and enjoy
music, books, and lectures. Accordingly, he
was the idol of the people, and the horror of
the old school of the manufacturers.</p>

<p>“A pretty upstart and demagogue I’ve
nurtured,” said Mr. Spires often to his wife
and daughter, who only sighed and were
silent.</p>

<p>Then came a furious election. The town<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
for a fortnight, more resembled the worst
corner of Tartarus, than a Christian borough.
Drunkenness, riot, pumping on one another,
spencering one another, that is, tearing each
other’s coat-tails off, all sorts of violence and
abuse ruled and raged, till the blood of all
Castleborough was at boiling heat. In the
midst of the tempest were everywhere seen,
ranged on the opposite sides, Mr. Spires, now
old and immensely corpulent, and Simon Deg,
active, buoyant, zealous, and popular beyond
measure. But popular though he still was,
the other and old tory side triumphed. The
people were exasperated to madness; and
when the chairing of the successful candidate
commenced, there was a terrific attack made
on the procession by the defeated party.
Down went the chair, and the new member,
glad to escape into an inn, saw his friends
mercilessly assailed by the populace. There
was a tremendous tempest of sticks, brickbats,
paving-stones and rotten eggs. In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
midst of this, Simon Deg, and a number of
his friends, standing at the upper window of
an hotel, saw Mr. Spires knocked down, and
trampled on by the crowd. In an instant,
and before his friends had missed him from
amongst them, Simon Deg was seen darting
through the raging mass, cleaving his way
with a surprising vigour, and gesticulating,
and, no doubt, shouting vehemently to the
rioters, though his voice was lost in the din.
In the next moment his hat was knocked off,
and himself appeared in imminent danger;
but another moment, and there was a pause,
and a group of people were bearing somebody
from the frantic mob into a neighbouring
shop. It was Simon Deg assisting in the
rescue of his old friend and benefactor, Mr.
Spires.</p>

<p>Mr. Spires was a good deal bruised, and
wonderfully confounded and bewildered by
his fall. His clothes were one mass of mud,
and his face was bleeding copiously; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
when he had had a good draught of water,
and his face washed, and had time to recover
himself, it was found that he had received no
serious injury.</p>

<p>“They had like to have done for me,
though,” said he.</p>

<p>“Yes; and who saved you?” asked a
gentleman.</p>

<p>“Ay, who was it? who was it?” asked
the really warm-hearted manufacturer. “Let
me know; I owe him my life.”</p>

<p>“There he is!” said several gentlemen at
the same instant, pushing forward Simon
Deg.</p>

<p>“What, Simon!” said Mr. Spires, starting
to his feet. “Was it thee, my boy?” He
did more—he stretched out his hand. The
young man clasped it eagerly; and the two
stood silent, and with a heartfelt emotion,
which blended all the past into forgetfulness,
and the future into a union more sacred than
esteem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>A week hence, and Simon Deg was the
son-in-law of Mr. Spires. Though Mr. Spires
had misunderstood Simon, and Simon had
borne the aspect of opposition to his old
friend, in defence of conscientious principles,
the wife and daughter of the manufacturer
had always understood him, and secretly
looked forward to some day of recognition
and re-union.</p>

<p>Simon Deg was now one of the richest men
in Castleborough. His mother was still living
to enjoy his elevation. She had been his
excellent and wise housekeeper, and she continued
to occupy that post still.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">THINGS AS THEY USED TO BE.</p>


<p>One of the first things which Simon Deg
did after Mr. Spires had so indignantly refused
him his daughter on account of his
origin, was to conceive and to carry out a
resolve that, however the brand of pauperism
might attach to his ancestors, none of its
obligations should lie on him. “Let past
generations settle their own accounts,” he
said; “but so far as this generation goes,
there is not a man of it shall say that I owe
the country, or rather this town, a farthing
for life and growth. If my father ever received
a bodle of parish-pay, which I know
not, or his father or father’s father for him,
it shall be repaid.” He went, therefore, successively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
to the committee of the poor in
each parish, of which the town contained
three, and desired permission to search the
pay-books of each of these parishes for the
last eighty years. “Beyond that period,” he
said, “there can be no man living who ever
paid a farthing to the poor-rates.” He did
not conceal the object of his research. It
was to ascertain, to a fraction, what amount
had been paid during that period to any individual
of the name of Deg. His position in
the town readily secured him this opportunity,
and he immediately employed an able
accountant in each parish to trace down,
through the books, items of these payments.
He promised, moreover, to the stipendiary,
or sub-overseers of the poor, a handsome
honorarium, to assist the accountant in seeing
that his work was done completely, and in
aiding him in any difficulty. He himself
frequently attended, and made tests, by going
over certain extents of these accounts, of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
accuracy with which they were done. It
was a great labour, and was not completed
much under a year. But it was accomplished
at last, and the result was a statement of
several thousand pounds as having been paid
to persons of the name of Deg. This amount
Simon Deg paid over with great satisfaction
to the respective committees, and took receipts
for it. The parish officers represented
to him that there was no reason whatever
that he should make so extraordinary a refundment
to the parish, from which neither
he himself nor his father in his own person
could be shown to have derived a penny.
Still more, they represented that Mr. Deg
could not be descended from all the Degs;
he could only have descended in one line,
and from that specific line did he only incur
even the shadow of an obligation to the
parishes.</p>

<p>Simon Deg replied, that that was true;
but, on the other hand, there was a female<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
side to the line, the fathers and mothers of
women who married Degs, and daughters of
Degs who married and passed under other
names, had swelled the account. He therefore
requested to be allowed to pay the whole
account, as it appeared under the name of
Deg; and this was done. He observed, that
he did not wish to dictate in any way the
manner in which these sums should be expended,
but he thought that the whole of
them might with advantage be employed in
extending and rendering more comfortable
those parts of the workhouses where the aged
paupers or the sick were accommodated; and
this suggestion was fully and freely complied
with.</p>

<p>This act of Simon Deg’s, demonstrating a
feeling of such a profound sense of honour
and integrity, made a grand impression on
his townspeople, and raised him still higher
in public estimation. In the course of his
inquiry he made the discovery that the family<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
name was in reality Degge, and had been
thus spelled from the earliest period till within
the last half of the last century. He therefore
resumed the dropped letters, as giving a
greater finish of the name to the eye; and
saying pleasantly that, as he had now discharged
the debts of his progenitors, at least
to this generation, he thought he might be
allowed to take the two last letters out of
pawn. Henceforth, therefore, he and every
one else wrote him Simon “Degge.”</p>

<p>Not long after his marriage, he bought a
farm at Hillmartin, a village not far from
Rockville. He was naturally of an active
temperament, was fond of riding, and took a
great fancy to farming and shooting. These
divertisements were all afforded him by this
little estate. After close confinement in his
counting-house, he liked to get on his horse,
and ride briskly out of town, over the old
Trent Bridge, and up the winding way to his
farm. Hillmartin was about three miles out,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
and stood on a fine, airy elevation, overlooking
the country round, and from this side
of it giving a full view of Castleborough.
Simon’s farm lay a little over the hill beyond
Hillmartin, and stretched in one direction
towards Gotham, and in another towards the
estate of Sir Benjamin Bullockshed.</p>

<p>Simon Degge’s purchase of this farm was
a subject of great annoyance to Sir Benjamin,
who was very anxious to have it, as it lay
alongside of his woods and game preserves.
The fact of seeing his pheasants, which had
found a favourite, because a plentiful feeding-place,
on this farm, shot down by Mr. Degge
and his numerous friends from Castleborough,
was, in truth, as great a misfortune as Sir Benjamin
well could imagine to himself. For a
quarter of a mile these woods of his ran along
the corn-lands of this farm. The previous
farmer had complained in vain of the depredations
of the game—hares, rabbits and
pheasants—which issued out of the preserves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
in legions. He was told that he must fence
them out, but the fence was Sir Benjamin’s;
and the farmer dared no more to put a stick
into it to stop their runs, than he dared have
taken a stick to Sir Benjamin himself. His
growing corn was trodden down by the hares
and rabbits; the hares, according to their
habit, cut paths through it, and made playgrounds
in it; the rabbits cropped it as fast
as it grew for fifty yards, all along the woodsides.
What escaped and went into ear was
regularly eaten up by the pheasants. They
sat on the hedges along the woodside as
tame as barn-door fowls, knowing well that
they were under powerful protection, and
during harvest, if a daring waggoner snapped
his whip at them, they disdained to move.
On a fine afternoon, so long as there was
anything to pick on the stubble, you might
see them feeding in flocks of a hundred
together, as quietly as fowls in a barn-yard.</p>

<p>The nuisance of this great game-manufactory,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
ruinous to the farmer, had compelled
one tenant after another to throw the farm
up. In fact, no one knowing the farm would
take it; they were only men from a distance
who did so, and were in terrible but vain
trepidation when they discovered the real
nature of the game-preserving incubus that
lay upon the land. In itself the land was
excellent, and, therefore, a stranger examining
it, who had not already lived in a game-preserving
country, was readily taken in by
it. If the farmer, on discovering the alarming
evil, complained, the answer from Sir
Benjamin’s steward was, as I have said,
“You can stop the runs in the hedges but
if the farmer did stop them, he found the
stoppage very soon removed by the keepers
in their nocturnal rounds. One bold farmer
had kept terriers to scour the woodsides;
but he soon found his dogs, when they
followed the game into the wood, shot, or
trapped in the iron traps so freely used by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
our English gamekeepers, who are the
greatest and most extensive animal torturers
that the world ever knew.</p>

<p>The farm, belonging to a gentleman of
Lincolnshire, he had, by the frequent change
of tenants, grown out of love with it, and had
offered it to Sir Benjamin at a moderate
price; but Sir Benjamin, who did not believe
any one thereabout would dare to come between
him and the vendor, was standing out
in the secure expectation of getting it at a
very low figure, when Simon Degge, who was
inquiring for such a farm, not far from town,
heard of it from a lawyer in Castleborough
who had carried on the negotiations with Sir
Benjamin for the owner. This gentleman
was much disgusted with the gross selfishness,
the many delays, and haughty conduct
of Sir Benjamin, and was delighted at
the opportunity of putting the property at
once and for ever out of his power. Mr.
Degge closed with the conditions of sale at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
once, and as the whole of the purchase-money
was ready, in a month the farm was
fully conveyed to him, and put into his
possession.</p>

<p>The consternation and indignation of Sir
Benjamin on receiving this intelligence may
be imagined. He saw at once that the tables
were now most completely turned against
him. He had no longer a half-informed and
comparatively poor farmer to contend with,
but a young man of great acknowledged ability
and wealth, as well as activity of character.
Instead of telling Mr. Degge to put sticks
and bushes into the runs of the hares,
rabbits, and pheasants, which his keepers
could pull out again, he himself ordered the
fences all along Mr. Degge’s farm to be made
game-tight. A fence, inside the hawthorn-fence,
of stakes about two feet long, which were
driven down nearly in contact, side by side,
was made to prevent egress from the preserves
to the farm. But all this did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
avail. The pheasants, as the corn ripened,
flew over the fences, and fed freely on Mr.
Degge’s corn. The hares travelled round
and squatted themselves down thickly in the
green crops of corn, grass, and clover; and
the rabbits burrowed under, requiring continually
the stopping of their holes: for
although the rabbits were less cared for by
Sir Benjamin, they were more cared for by
his keepers, who made a profitable perquisite
out of them.</p>

<p>On his part, Mr. Degge did not trouble
himself at all about a certain amount of
damage done by this game to his crops
along the woodside; for the money value did
not distress him, and he looked on that part
of the farm as a nursery for the game which
he meant to invite his Castleborough friends
in the autumn to shoot.</p>

<p>But the annoyance to Sir Benjamin and
his friends did not end here. Scattered about
on that side of the country lay the estates of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
a number of squires—the Tenterhooks, Sheepshanks,
Otterbrooks, Swagsides, &amp;c.—who were
of a thoroughly countryfied school. They
were men not destitute of a certain amount
of education, but who had no tastes beyond
those of living on their property, and
being the lords paramount as far as it extended.
To be the great men of their little
ancestral spots of earth; to rule over the
farmers; to rear and destroy game; to officiate
as magistrates, and convict poachers and
petty culprits—that was the extent of their
ambition. They seldom frequented the
metropolis, or mixed in the society of the
more elevated and refined aristocracy. They
formed a circle of society of their own,
looking proudly down on the moneyed men
of the market town, on the farmers and
villagers around them—at once ignorant
of all superior knowledge, proud, and
arbitrary.</p>

<p>That a man of the manufacturing town<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
should have dared to step in, and catch away
a valuable farm from before Sir Benjamin
Bullockshed’s very nose, and, as they said, in
actually gasping astonishment, whilst he was
in negotiation for it, was a piece of audacity
which really took away their breath. It was
ominous of fresh attempts of the kind. The
sanctity of the country and of game was no
longer secure from the unhallowed inroads of
plebeian audacity. Sir Roger Rockville, whose
property also at one point came up to Mr.
Degge’s farm, was in a state of most imbecile
exasperation at this event. The dreaded
manufacturing town was thus already marching
into the very heart of the country; and of
the manufacturing town, the very worst in his
eyes of its odious population. For who was
this Degge? he asked. A pauper, and the
last of a long line of paupers. It mattered
not that Mr. Degge had most fully discharged
the pauper debt so far as this generation was
concerned. To Sir Roger it was only another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
proof of the upstart pride and abundance of
money of this dangerous class.</p>

<p>The sensation which this shocking event, as
it was called, created in the whole circle of this
squirearchy was visible at the meetings of these
men of the earth, earthy, at their dinner-parties
at each other’s houses, and at their meetings
at the justice-rooms, and their morning rides
to one another’s houses. A feeling of strange
inveteracy was entertained against Simon
Degge. If any of them met him on the highway
as they rode to or from Castleborough,
they scowled at him as though he had been a
most suspicious character. More than once,
when two of them were together, he had
heard them remark to one another—for it
was done loud enough for him to hear it—“That
is that upstart pauper, Degge.” If any
labourer of his could be caught on any pretence,
and brought before them, as magistrates,
he was sure to be handled with the
utmost severity and the least possible modicum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
of justice; and when Mr. Degge went
forward to speak a word in his defence, he
was sure to be treated with a marked contempt,
and even incivility.</p>

<p>This proceeding did not tend on Mr.
Degge’s part to excite any pleasant feelings
in his bosom towards these lords of the soil;
but he maintained a demeanour of true gentlemanliness
and self-respect. At the same
time that he certainly felt a great satisfaction
in the idea of the sweeping devastation of the
game which he and his friends would make
in the autumn, and which he was sure no
precautions could prevent making its way to
his fields so long as there was a better pasture
there, or whilst he scattered a quantity of
barley on his stubbles, after the corn naturally
shed on them had been gathered off by the
pheasants.</p>

<p>Such was the state of feelings all round
Simon Degge’s new farm. So far as he himself
was concerned, it seemed only to amuse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
him and his town friends, but to the whole
squiral group, including Sir Roger Rockville,
it was an acute, and promised to become a
chronic condition of gall and wormwood.
Mr. Degge brought his mother to live at the
house belonging to the farm, for she delighted
in the country;—not at the farm-house, for
there he had a bailiff, but in a large old house
at the village of Hillmartin itself, with a fine
old-fashioned garden; and there himself and
Mrs. Degge spent a great deal of the fine
summer weather.</p>

<p>Simon Degge had also removed William
Watson from his cottage by the farm meadow,
and from his trade, and he was now acting as
a sort of orderly at Mr. Degge’s chief manufactory.
He occupied the lodge, and walked
about, and saw that all was safe, and moving
as it should do.</p>

<p>There were several wealthy and intelligent
families in the neighbourhood of Mr. Degge’s
farm, who, however, at once acknowledged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
the distinguished merit and virtues of this
young man, and who did not hesitate to call
on him and Mrs. Degge, much to the disgust
of the class of country gentlemen of whom I
have spoken. These, it must be admitted,
had indeed little in common with men of
game and warrants, and did not stand
very highly in their favour before. Let us
see whether they may not present a more
agreeable aspect to us.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">THE WOODBURNS AND THEIR NEIGHBOURS.</p>


<p>Amongst the families which called on the
Degges was that of Mr. Leonard Woodburn,
of Woodburn Grange. The Woodburns did
not belong to the so-called great families of
the county, but to those of smaller but independent
estate, whose heads were formerly
classed under the name of yeomen. Mr.
Woodburn was the possessor of about four
hundred acres of freehold land, beautifully
situated about a mile beyond Rockville, in
the vicinity of the Trent, and beautifully
cultivated. The house was one of those old
Elizabethan ones with a variety of projections,
pointed gables, and mullioned windows.
The chimneys were of the cross-banded and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
ornamented kind which are now regarded as
extremely beautiful, and, indeed, they had
been thought so a good while ago, for the
father of Sir Thomas Tenterhook, when rebuilding
Tenterhook Hall, had asked the
father of the present Mr. Woodburn if he
had any objection to sell them. A proposal,
which Mr. Woodburn had with true yeoman
feeling of independence, regarded as so great
an insult, that he turned his back on the
baronet as he sat at his gate on horseback,
and in presence of his groom, and closing the
gate pretty sharply, walked into the house
without deigning a reply.</p>

<p>The present Mr. Woodburn, who had been
the only son, was a man of a liberal education,
fond of classical literature, and more
deeply learned in all the history, both general
and family, of the county, than any other
man in it. Nay, there was scarcely a family
of any note in England of which he did not
possess a knowledge which continually surprised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
you. He had a real love for topography
and family history, which had led
him, as it would seem, insensibly to acquire
not only this knowledge of domestic annals,
but of the titles of almost all the estates in
the county, many copies of which, curious
and important in their way, he possessed;
and this knowledge made him a great authority
in cases of disputed title, and had led
him to decide the issue of several most noted
trials. He had a habit also of noting down
all sorts of curious facts which came to his
knowledge either in the course of his reading
of books, or of the newspapers, or which he
heard verbally. These <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">curiosa</i> had accumulated
into several volumes, which he kept
locked up in his desk, and which he would
bring out occasionally as something of public
interest was occurring, or as something in
conversation had suggested the reference.
A somewhat odd medley a stranger would
have regarded the contents of these volumes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
for amongst public and important facts,
would be found jotted down birth-days, dates
of weddings, and funerals of his family or
neighbours; and even remarkable cases of
prolificness of fowls, cattle, and fruit-trees on
his farm. There was an entry of the turkey,
or the hen that had laid away in the
copse or the thicket, and came forth unexpectedly
with some fifteen or twenty pouts,
or chickens. The tame hawk, which was
reared by George, his son, and suddenly flying
away, became not only wild, but the scourge
of his poultry-yard, by making continual
visits to it, till at length shot, stands in
immediate succession to the history of the
lawyer of the neighbouring town, who, reared
at the cost of the clergyman of Cotmanhaye,
whose shoeblack and errand boy he had
originally been, had grown rich by harassing
the poor people of the country round by all
sorts of vexatious suits.</p>

<p>Mr. Woodburn was a quiet gentleman, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
somewhat above the middle stature, now approaching
fifty. He would not at that time of
day have been addressed by letter as esquire,
though every man who is not exactly a
sweep or a costermonger is so now. He
would be written down, however, Leonard
Woodburn of Woodburn, gent., in any public
document, or county summons on judicial
service. Mr. Woodburn might be seen daily
riding on a good sturdy horse about his
farm, and in harvest time he did not hesitate
to take a hand at raking or forking in the
hay-field, or binding after his reapers in the
corn-field; and on such occasions his children
would turn out for a frolic, rather than for
serious work. His harvest done, Leonard
Woodburn shot over his own land, accompanied
by his son George, now just come of
age, and who was treading in his father’s
steps, being fond of both agricultural pursuits
and of the gun.</p>

<p>Mrs. Woodburn was a fine, large, comely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
woman, who, though as well educated as the
ladies generally of her day, and fond of
hearing books read in winters’ evenings
rather than reading them herself, had her
heart and pride in her house and her dairy.
Churning, cheese-making, looking after her
fowls, her eggs, her calves, and pigs, and
pigeons, her ducks, geese, turkeys, guinea-fowls,
her fruit both of garden and orchard,
storing it up, or preserving it; these were the
great business of her daily life, and afforded
her a perpetual satisfaction. It was a real
delight to see Mrs. Woodburn amid her daily
duties of this kind, with her handsome, sunny,
smiling face, and tall and ample but active
figure, directing her maids, or helping even
in an emergency, or, to instruct a novice,
kneeling on a soft bass, leaning over the side
of the large brass pan, with her fair, full,
and finely rounded arms bared to near the
shoulder, crushing down the curd in the
whey, or crumbling it and pressing it into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
vat. Or you might see her surrounded by
a large flock of glossy pigeons in the farm-yard,
who had descended from their tower
surmounting one of the buildings to receive
her daily bounty. Not that Mrs. Woodburn
deemed it her express duty to feed any of
the farm-yard creatures; that belonged to
the men-folk, who not only foddered horses
and cows, but fed pigs and poultry, and the
pigeons came down quickly and put in for
their share with the numerous and scuffling
family of ducks, geese, turkeys, and all the
rest of them.</p>

<p>It was the custom of farm-houses, and the
custom reigned at Woodburn Grange, for the
mistress of the house to receive the profits on
pigs, calves and poultry, with all their eggs,
feathers, or other appurtenances. These were
her perquisites, with the butter, in most cases,
to furnish her wardrobe and for spending
money. It was, therefore, natural that the
farmer’s wife should keep a patronising eye<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
on the creatures within her province, and
Mrs. Woodburn thus frequently made her
visit to the farm-yard; saw whether the
pigs were well fed and bedded, and that all
the feathered flocks in the yard, or in the
paddock, or on the pond were prosperous.
The dairymaid fed the calves till they were
ready for the butcher, or to be turned out
into the orchard, where they at first galloped
with cocked tails, to and fro, with a frantic
velocity that made it marvellous that they
did not crack their silly, but joyful skulls
against the trees. For some time after their
liberation from the calf-house to daylight
and freedom, they were the dairymaid’s care,
and Mrs. Woodburn taking her rambles
through the ample kitchen-garden, could
stand and survey the infant herd with professional
and a sort of motherly satisfaction.</p>

<p>Besides their son George, the Woodburns
had two daughters, the elder one, who was
really the oldest of the three children, was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
sedate, but kindly Ann. Ann at this epoch was
four or five-and-twenty: of middle stature,
an extremely neat figure; of a very sweet,
serious countenance. Quiet, thoughtful, very
prudent in her disposition, but with warm
and deep, but not demonstrative feelings.
Ann loved music, and played well on the
piano, on which she was frequently called
to charm away the evening hours when
the family was assembled. She was fond
of reading, but not of a very wide range
of literature. She had her favourite books of
poetry and piety in her own room, and had
the strongest attachment to certain authors.
They were those who touched her heart
rather than excited her imagination, and
their thoughts and sentiments were familiar
to her mind as her own thoughts. In the
light literature of the day she took comparatively
little interest, though she was
ever ready to read to her mother what she
liked. Ann devoted herself to the cares of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
the house, but not of the farm. She saw
that the meals were all duly prepared and
served: saw that all the rooms were kept
in nicest order; helped often to make a
pudding or a pie, and took care, if guests
were expected, that all was in order to receive
and entertain them. Besides these
duties, Ann loved the garden, rejoiced in
tending the flowers, and looking after the
bees, which had a large shed, and occupied
several shelves in it with their hives towards
the lower and sunniest corner of the garden.
Such was Ann, quiet, cheerful, loving, and
busy, but never bustling. Every one relied
much on her clear, good sense and loving
interest in them: every one consulted her
in their difficulties, and received from her
almost invariably, the very wisest counsels.
Mr. Woodburn said Ann was like many other
still waters, she was deep, and his familiar
name for her was, “Old Sobersides.”</p>

<p>The last of the flock was the lively, laughing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
Letitia, seldom called anything but Letty.
Sweet Letty was about seventeen; with all
the vivacity, and eager frank life of a schoolgirl.
In fact, she was that till the other day.
Now, she was the sunshine, the flying,
quivering sunshine called Jack-a-dandy, sent
by reflection from a basin of water over walls
and ceilings in blithest dance. Letty, like
the Jack-a-dandy, was here and there, in the
house, in the garden, full of joy and love of
all things around her; with a face more
charming than beautiful, all smiles and frolic,
Letty was ready to lend a helping hand to
her mother or sister; full of talk and question,
making every one glad with her own gladness,
and ready to take a stroll or a ride with her
father or George, and to astonish them with
the frank, open, genuine expressions of her
young and innocent heart. Everything they
told her of the people or the things amid
which they lived interested her, and any
relation of cruel or unkind treatment of any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
one, fetched up the colour of a most lovely
roseate indignation to her young, pure cheek,
and the warmest expressions of it to her
tongue. Such was blithe Letty—simple, yet
shrewd, loving and light-hearted, the happy
embodiment of ardent and out-blossoming
womanhood.</p>

<p>But Woodburn Grange was a spot made
for a happy home, for substantial ease and
abundance, not for grandeur. There was
everything there which enabled its possessors
to enjoy the country. A handsome
income; all the rural luxuries of life; horses,
an open, but not a close carriage, a boat on
the charming river below, hearts ready to
love good and intelligent neighbours, and
such neighbours to love.</p>

<p>The old house stood in its ample gardens.
A low brick wall, surmounted by a hedge of
roses fenced it in from the road, which ran by
from the village to Cotmanhaye, and further
up the valley. A straight walk led up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
to the handsome, ample porch—you could
not enter the garden in a carriage, but must
walk up it,—in summer, amid a glow and
perfume of flowers and a murmur of bees,
and a flickering dance of butterflies, that
was delicious. Around and beyond the house
extended the flower-garden with evergreens,
and here and there a fruit-tree. Then down
the slope stretched the kitchen-garden, with
its tall south fruit wall, with its trellises
of roses and jasmines bordering beds of
raspberries and gooseberries. Its abundant
growth of peas, beans, and all vegetables, its
asparagus beds, strawberry beds, beds of salsify
and scorzonera; its quince and medlar
and filbert trees. Then, below still, stretched
an old orchard, with seats here and there
under its trees, some of the old trees stooping
one way, some another; and at the bottom
ran the Trent, in phrase of Christopher North,
“one of the sincerest streams in England.”</p>

<p>Tolerably elevated stood the house, overlooking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
undulating fields, studded with cattle
and sheep, or waving with corn, the patrimonial
estate, and beyond them the woods of
Cotmanhaye, and across the river an expanse
of level meadows of some miles in width,
with the ruddy walls of the village of Breton
bounding them. On the other hand, southward,
rose a range of sand cliffs, at the foot of which
ran the highway from Rockville to Cotmanhaye,
and still beyond the cliffs, and the
patches of trees on their brow, rose the country
to the large farming village of Hillmartin.</p>

<p>Leonard Woodburn, of Woodburn Grange,
though styled but yeoman, had a homestead
which a king might envy, and when Simon
and Mrs. Degge returned the Woodburns’
call, they could not sufficiently express their
delight at it, and went over the house and the
cheese-chamber, with its growing display of
goodly cheeses, over the farm-yard, and
through garden and orchard. They were
charmed with the view from the windows,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
which were different from their own, and no
less with the kindly intelligence of the Woodburns
themselves, free, simple, and at ease;
and inly promised themselves much pleasure
in their friendship, which they resolved to
cultivate.</p>

<p>Before rambling farther in our discoveries
in this neighbourhood, we have still a friend
of ours to introduce at the Grange, and then
a promenade to make through the village—at
least to make a passing note of it, and say,
“Here lives so-and-so, and there lives somebody
else.” Our acquaintance at the Grange
is only a servant, however. It is Betty
Trapps, a sort of miscellany of housemaid
and cook, in past days adding something of
the nurse to the rest of her duties. Betty
has lived with the Woodburns since she was
five-and-twenty, and she is now—let me see—what?
Five-and thirty? Yes—she has
lived at least fifteen years at the Grange, and
that makes her—upon my word!—forty!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
And yet Betty does not look more than five-and-thirty.
She is middle-sized, middle-bulkish
in body, but lithe and active. Never
idle, never weary, never ill, never grumbling,
but with a wit and a will of her own, and
always ready to give, as she says, as good as
she gets. In fact, they must be awake that
venture on a jest or trick with Betty. She is
the freest of free-spoken women: Mr. Woodburn,
who likes a good-natured nickname,
calls her “Meg Merrymouth.” She says often
what she thinks—almost unmercifully; and
yet Betty is full of kindness, and is knowing
and shrewd. There is nobody thereabout
that can see half so thoroughly through those
she comes into contact with. But we shall
see Betty Trapps again, for she says she
means to stay at the Grange as long as there
is a tile on the house, unless Master should
discharge her for chaffing a little, and she
does not think he will. And she has given a
good many proofs that she means to keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
her word, for Betty is a Methodist, and is a
woman of consequence at chapel and at the
class, and has had a good many offers of
marriage from the brethren, some very well
to do; and Betty has so far always said,
“No, thank you.” Civilly, be it understood,
and as secretly as possible, for she does not
really, smart as she is sometimes, like to hurt
any one’s feelings. But Betty is shrewdly
supposed to have saved a pretty little stock
of money, having lived so long in a good
place, and never indulged in finery, and the
brethren may not be always so easily rebuffed,
for this is one of those charms which
continue growing even when others fade.
However, the tiles on Woodburn Grange are
extremely good yet, so we shall see.</p>

<p>A little above Woodburn Grange, and
nearer to Rockville, lies the village of Woodburn.
It is not very large, and chiefly built
round a spacious green, on which the young
men in summer evenings enjoy their games<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
of cricket, ninepins, bowls, and quoits. At
the corner where the road enters the green
from Rockville, and, of course, from Castleborough,
stands the blacksmith’s shop, where
frequently two or three farm-horses stand
waiting to be shod; and a number of ploughs
and harrows lie expecting repairs. There
the sturdy smith, Job Latter, is generally
found working and perspiring, and conversing
with a number of village-lads and
young men hanging about, whom he contrives
to disperse when they incommode him, by
rubbing his hot iron in his heap of sand, and
thus sending a storm of burning stars in
every direction, that makes a sudden scamper.
Not far thence, a congregation of dilapidated
carts, waggons, and disabled wheels, mark
the shop of Will Spokeshave, the wainwright.
In the centre of the south side of the green,
rises a somewhat large old house with porch
and tall gabled roof, which is the village
school, frequented, more particularly in winter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
by the farmers’ and labourers’ sons of
the neighbourhood. This school has now
for master a worthy half-Welshman, named
Howell Crusoe (after his mother and father),
a man noted far around as “a great scollard”—a
very great, long-headed “scollard.”
He has written a book to teach boys good
manners, and a genuine curiosity it is in its
way; and his profound acquaintance with
the customs of polite society may be at once
discerned by the following rules in this his
“Book of Etiquette for Boys”—a work now
become very rare, yet of which an odd, and it
must be admitted, a <em>very</em> odd copy, may now
and then be met with on the shelves of the
bookworms of Castleborough:—“When a
gentleman or lady speaks to you”—thus
teaches Howell Crusoe boy-etiquette—“immediately
touch your forehead with the back
of your right hand; then place three fingers
of the same hand between the buttons of the
centre of your waistcoat, and expect the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
observations of your superior in an attitude
of easy but respectful attention. At any
remark of the respected lady or gentleman,
incline your head with a graceful dignity,
and scrape backward with your left foot.
Whenever you are asked to sit down in company,
place one leg over the other; rest your
elbow on the elevated knee, repose your chin
on the hand of the same arm, with two
fingers extended upright between your cheek
and your ear. In an attitude at once so easy
and so graceful, await the wisdom which is
sure to fall from beauty, learning, and experience,
and hoard up the precious results for
the future occasions of life, as the busy bee
hoards up the honey of spring for the winter
of age.”</p>

<p>A company of boys educated by Crusoe,
or on Crusoe’s plan, seated round a room in
his most approved attitude, must have been
a pleasing sight!</p>

<p>Crusoe is the oracle of the “Grey Goose,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
the public-house opposite; for he has a number
of theories which he there defends against
all comers, and very few comers, it may be
supposed, ever go away having won any sort
of advantage over the erudite Howell Crusoe.</p>

<p>Howell has distinguished himself in his
determined onslaughts on bull-baiting, dog-fighting,
badger-baiting, cock-fighting, and
the like; and has been supported in these
eventually successful achievements by Jasper
Heritage, David Qualm, and Sylvanus Crook,
persons as yet unknown to the reader, but to
whom I most probably shall, by permission,
very soon introduce them. Howell does not
find, however, that he can altogether dispense
with boy-baiting, or beating with his cane.
He manages to frighten the young ones,
nevertheless, by threatening to “look over
their heads to the wall,” which has something
awful in it to their imaginations; and he
thinks, in time, cudgels may be used to drive
beasts with, and boys be ruled by appealing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
to what Sylvanus Crook calls their “inner
man.” Howell Crusoe is also secretary of
both men and women’s clubs, and is much
disgusted with the drunkenness displayed by
these members at Whitsuntide; finds, indeed,
he has a rude and uncouth generation to deal
with, and makes but little progress in refining
them. In a word, Howell Crusoe is an out-and-out
social reformer.</p>

<p>Not far from the village on the Rockville-road,
you see a large pair of gates, a capacious
lodge with flowering plants in the windows,
and under one of them a little wooden trough,
very much resembling a pig-trough. It is, in
fact, a trough which Sylvanus Crook, the
good Quaker, who lives at this gentleman’s
lodge, has set there for the refreshment of
dogs, having often seen them passing with
lolling tongues, and eyes anxiously cast about
for water. Sylvanus soon had his first trough
stolen, but this he has secured by stout iron
fastenings to the wall, and he trusts that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
relieves much canine discomfort. He says,
indeed, that he has never had the pleasure
of seeing a dog drink at it; neither has
Dorothy, his wife; but he hopes they do.
At least they have the opportunity.</p>

<p>But this lodge is but the entrance to the
extensive grounds and house of Jasper Heritage,
the wealthy Quaker banker of Castleborough.
Enter; advance up the well-kept
carriage-drive, and very soon you will see
standing on an open, level, extensive lawn, a
very large square brick house. It is one of
the country houses so frequently seen, which
are built at no expense of architecture whatever.
It is as simple and as exactly square
as any box or square block of stone that you
can see anywhere. Take a good, big deal
box, chalk on it a door in the centre, and two
or three rows of windows, and a parapet-wall
at the top, showing no roof, and then you
have the exact representation of some hundreds,
or, indeed, thousands of houses which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
raise themselves as proudly on the soil of
England, as if they boasted all the architectural
graces ever displayed. And truly
they are houses capable of lodging and
entertaining a great number of people in the
perfection of comfort. They are ample,
convenient, and opulent abodes of opulent
families, though they look so cubical and
featureless outside. This house of Mr. Jasper
Heritage, is, moreover, made somewhat attractive
by such ornaments as the very simple
taste of its owner could, or perhaps would,
give it. It has an ample portico on plain
Tuscan pillars; a broad flight of easy stone
steps up to it; a very highly-burnished
brass-knocker and bell-handle; and in a row
under the windows, a range of splendid
orange-trees in large square tubs, and a
fountain in the centre of the lawn, which
plays on particular occasions. Right and
left you see broad, exquisitely rolled gravel
walks going off into very tempting-looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
shrubberies and gardens. Ah! it will be a
great treat to penetrate in there, and see all
the lawns and alleys, and gardens, ponds, and
conservatories, and snug summer-houses in
corners, which give you from a second storey
a prospect over the country round. But we
must come again some day for that. We
shall get an invitation. Now it is enough to
say, that in that house is not Jasper Heritage;
he is just now at his bank in Castleborough,
whither his coachman, Sylvanus Crook, also
a Friend, and dressed in the plainest drab,
with the most approved cocked-hat and knee-breeches
of that society, and that day, has
driven him, and will fetch him back, at four
o’clock, in the handsome, roomy dark-green
family carriage, without, I may add, the
slightest vanity of coat-of-arms, crest, or any
such badge of a worldly pride. At home, are—but
not to be intruded upon by us at this
moment, for they are busy cutting out a very
multitude of clothes for the Dorcas Society—yes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
there are Rebecca Heritage, the wealthy
banker’s wife, and Millicent Heritage, the fair
and only child of this wealthy banker—only
think of that! What! you say, is the young
lady handsome? Oh, don’t be so curious!
Wait a bit. I will tell you about the mother
first. Mrs. Rebecca Heritage is a lady of
apparently forty-five. She is not very tall,
she is not very short, she is not very thin,
nor very stout; but she is fair, very fair,
yet with dark hair neatly laid back from the
centre of the forehead under a very white and
very plain Quaker cap. A silk gown she
wears—pale very dovelike silk; a white muslin
handkerchief covers her shoulders and bosom,
and she has extremely well-cut features. Her
nose is perfect. Her eyes blue-grey, large,
and thoughtful. Her forehead is broad and
ample, and, in a word, she looks like a grave
and comely duchess dressed up for a female
Friend in a domestic theatrical. In that
noble face—in that smooth, soft, yet healthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
face—where no approach to a wrinkle, one
thinks, would ever dare to come—there is a
thought, a spirit, a fire—yes, a fire—even in
the calm that rules all in that tranquil aspect.
Depend upon it, Rebecca Heritage is no common
woman. She is like one of those women
Friends, who used to enter Whitehall, and
tell the king-destroyer Cromwell or the
laughing, reckless Charles II., in tones that
made them still as children, of the oppression
of the saints which they were perpetrating;
of the foul and hideous dungeons in which
they were holding those whose only crime
was a religion of peace. There! if you
want the picture of a mother in Israel—of
a brave, self-possessed, yet loving and large-hearted
woman—send for a painter, and let
him pourtray Rebecca Heritage.</p>

<p>But I see you glancing aside from this
figure of heroic piety and peace to that
gentle creature at her side. Lovely, modest,
retiring Millicent. So rich, and yet nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
has heaped all those other riches upon her.
Look at that very fair face, at those clear
blue eyes, and yet shaded by such long dark
eye-lashes, such finely-arched jetty eye-brows
and hair. Why it is not an English, but
a genuine Eastern beauty. That form and
face were evidently made for an Asiatic
palace, and they are here, in a Quaker house,
and busy in cutting out jackets and petticoats
for the squalid brats of the next town. Come
away! It is too dangerous here. I must
show you Still Lodge, it is just outside the
grounds here. There! You see it—a genuine
little wrens nest: and in it dwells David
Qualm, the brother-in-law of Jasper Heritage,
and Dorothy Qualm, his wife. Oh, most
peaceable and peace-loving people! You
will come again,—don’t linger. Remember
when you inquire for the house of Jasper
Heritage, it is called Fair-Manor.</p>

<p>One more introduction, and then enough
for the present. We must now turn back,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
pass through the villages of Rockville and
Woodburn, give a nod to pleasant Woodburn
Grange as we pass, and so on a mile farther,
skirting the feet of the sand-cliffs, till we
stand on a fine mount with a modern-looking
mansion, also of brick; they all are so round
about here. This mansion is the seat of Sir
Emanuel Clavering, a baronet of an old
family. Finely stands the house with its
large bay windows looking out on its velvet
lawn, from the soft, smooth turf of which
spring stately elms and ashes, with that
luxury of neatness which only aristocratic
trees can wear. Finely sweep the swelling
slopes of the hill down to the river, which
there takes a superb bend, and across it the
eye runs on to distant towers, and masses of
woods, and clumps of pine-clad hills high and
dark. Near the house stands the picturesque
parsonage, half covered with ivy, and here
and there a cottage, and that is Cotmanhaye—there
is no village. Opposite to the house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
southward, or south-west, rises a still higher
range of hills, and on climbing that, you
behold another landscape, vast and varied,
villages, farms, and woods.</p>

<p>Sir Emanuel Clavering is a tall gentlemanly
man of sixty. All who know him
declare him a man of very pleasant manners,
extremely well read; fond of poetry, but of
the Pope school, which he declares to be the
only polished and correct one; and given to
astronomical, and it is said abstruse studies.
There is a small tower at some distance
on the ridge of the hill, which he uses
as an observatory. In his youth he was
away, no one knows where, for a space
of seven years. Those who have seen
him often and inspected him closely, assert
that the gristle of his nose is bored, as
savages bore theirs to insert a feather or a
flower. Hence, there is a popular story—an
imagination, for Sir Emanuel has never been
known to utter a word to his most intimate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
friends, either of this curious fact, or of the
sojourn of those years. The country people
talk fluently by their firesides of Sir Emanuel
in his wild youth as the head of some wild
race, the lord of some dark-eyed, dark-skinned
princess. They have romanced out a
grand story of his leading the devoted natives
to battle, with all the terrors of European
arms, and winning great victories and domains
for them. They account for his return by the
death of his princess, a creature of wondrous
beauty, and by the natural longings for one’s
native land. Not a syllable of this story has
a basis of ascertained fact, not the ground of
a single allusion the most distant; all those
years are a blank to every one but Sir
Emanuel himself. Nothing more is known
than that he returned to find his father dead,
and his younger brother, the rector, holding
the estate for him. He had neither brother
nor sister besides Thomas the rector. In a
few years, during which he was about a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
deal in London, and from which gentlemen
of his own tastes sometimes came down and
shut themselves up for days with him in his
tower, and were seen riding about with him,
Sir Emanuel married. Not, however, one of
the daughters of any of the neighbouring
aristocratic families, but the daughter of the
bailiff of his estate. His wife had still fewer
relatives than himself, she had no brother or
sister. She was a naturally fine woman, and
bore her elevation with modesty and good
sense. The habits of Sir Emanuel became
more secluded than before. The neighbouring
families rarely called on him. His life
was chiefly spent in prosecuting the studies
of his tower, in field sports, in fishing, and in
occasional visits to the metropolis.</p>

<p>Such a character was sure to become the
object of the most extraordinary rumours in
the country round. His astronomical studies,
his frequent walks at midnight to his solitary
tower, followed by two large black dogs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
his being seen by the keepers sometimes
wrapped in his cloak, silently pacing along
that bleak and elevated ridge in darkness
and in the wildest tempests, was enough to
add in the popular mind, to his astronomy,
other and darker studies. The peasantry
universally believed that he dealt in the
black art; they asserted that he had been
seen at the same hour in two different places
thirty miles apart; they said that there was
nothing lost anywhere in the neighbourhood
but he would say, immediately on hearing of
it, where it was, or who had got it; and that
he was always right. He always told the
farmers what sort of a summer or winter it
would be, which was certain to take place;
and he had been known on hearing of a
wedding, whether in high or low life, to shake
his head and say that would not be lucky,
and it never was. All these things he probably
pronounced from the simple sources of
natural sagacity and extended knowledge,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
perfectly legitimate in its character; but the
people far around took another and more
mysterious view of it. They observed that
though his brother was the clergyman, and
the living belonging to the family, he rarely
appeared at church; and the peasantry when
they saw him felt a secret terror, though he
always accosted them most kindly; was
always cheerful, and even jocose, and never
heard of a case of distress which he did not
send to relieve.</p>

<p>Sir Emanuel, contrary to his wont, called
on the Degges, and they returned his call,
curious to make the acquaintance of a man
of so peculiar a reputation. They were
greatly struck with the polished friendliness
of his manner, his frank cordiality, and his
superior intelligence. He assured them that
he had great pleasure in the prospect of
cultivating their friendship. Lady Clavering
had been deceased some years; he had but
one son, Henry Clavering, who had been the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
school-fellow of George Woodburn, at Repton,
and who was on terms of great friendship
with all the family at Woodburn Grange.</p>

<p>And thus I have presented a few of the
leading <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dramatis personæ</i>; others are waiting
in the side-scenes ready to make their
appearance.</p>

<p class="center">BETTY TRAPPS COMES TO NOTICE.</p>


<p>The life of Rockville, Woodburn, and their
vicinities presented little to chronicle for
some time. Simon Degge was angrily commented
upon by the neighbouring squirearchy,
for having thrown open the game on his
estate to the farmers. “This is the way,”
they said at their mutual dinners, “with these
plebeians. Having no taste for gentlemanly
sport themselves, they would like to see it
annihilated, and the landed proprietors reduced
for amusement to flocking to Castleborough,
and winding cotton-balls, or manufacturing
stockings.” This idea was very
much applauded, and made the ladies of the
county very merry. “We must all go to help<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
the gentlemen,” they said, “and seam hose, and
help to ‘take in.’” Mr. Markham, the rector
of Rockville, though agreeing with his landed
friends in the main idea, said he was bound
to say that Mr. Degge was rather a keen
sportsman, and a prodigious good shot. He
had seen him drop his birds right and left in
a most masterly way; where he had picked
up the skill rather puzzled him. Certainly,
it could not come by nature, as Dogberry
thought reading and writing did; but it
must be admitted that he was a prodigiously
clever man. And, in fact, unless he had
been, how could he have got on so?</p>

<p>“How do good-looking fellows manage to
marry rich heiresses?” asked Sir Benjamin
Bullockshed.</p>

<p>“Ah, well; but that was not altogether the
way that Mr. Degge had mounted into such
fortune. No, no; it was too well known that
he had got rich before he got the rich wife.
<em>He</em> was not going to be the panegyrist of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
Degge; he did not approve of letting either
farmers or hosiers loose on the game. By no
means; and, besides, Degge had no taste at
all for coursing, nor for hunting.”</p>

<p>“How should he?” asked Sir Thomas
Tenterhook. “Probably, in his younger days
he might manage to leap over a counter, but
I should like to see him take a good hawthorn
fence with a ditch on the other side,
or a five-barred gate.”</p>

<p>“But he could do it; nay, I have seen
him do it,” said Mr. Markham, “in riding
over his farm one day; and if he had hunted
all his life, he could not have shown himself
more at home in the saddle.”</p>

<p>“Gad! Markham,” said Sir Thomas, “but
Degge has turned your head marvellously in
a very little time. Why, you are a regular
trumpeter for him. By your account he is
possessed of all the graces and endowments
of a specimen man.”</p>

<p>“Oh! don’t you believe it, Sir Thomas.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
It is nonsense,” replied Mr. Markham; “it is
useless to deny what is plain to everybody;
but I join you in all you say of Degge’s vulgar
impudence in presuming to snatch a property,
as it were, out of the hands of such a gentleman
as Sir Benjamin Bullockshed, and in
letting loose half the hosiers of Castleborough
on Sir Benjamin’s game.”</p>

<p>“On Sir Benjamin’s game!” said Sir Roger
Rockville; “on all our game. He has encouraged
the poachers to an audacity never
known before. They all say, ‘There, Mr.
Degge has shown his sense. He knows that
game is everybody’s.’ Our keepers have
now no rest day nor night. The fields, the
woods, the copses swarm with poachers. After
them, and they are over the hedges into
Degge’s land, and touch ’em there who dare.
Sooner than we should convict them, he
would give every man of them a keeper’s
licence. That arch scamp, Joe Scammell, I
am told, sends cart-loads of hares and pheasants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
to Castleborough every week. Can no
one lay hold of that fellow? His offences
are now so many, he might be transported.”</p>

<p>“But what matters half-a-dozen Scammells
being sent out of the country,” said Sir
Thomas Tenterhook, “when every labourer or
artizan is encouraged by the example of Degge,
who is only a poacher on a larger scale?
They preach that all must live. Now let me
tell you something. Close to my estate, and
by the high road to Castleborough, there lives
a shoemaker, in a village, who was had up and
fined for shooting a hare in his garden last
winter but one. That fellow the very next
season took out a licence, for the right of a
shot over his own garden, and he could not be
turned out of it. So Degge made him one
of his keepers, and thus qualified him; and
all this last autumn and winter, he has sat
at his window and shot my hares and
pheasants. Not content with daylight, he
has kept this fine game by moonlight. Gad!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
the fellow is making a little fortune out
of it.”</p>

<p>There was a universal murmur of indignation
at such an instance of unheard-of
audacity.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Sir Benjamin Bullockshed,
“that is precisely the case in point. My game
is drained off by constantly getting into
some one of Degge’s fields, and being killed by
one of his stocking-weaver acquaintances. I
say, Mr. Markham, spite of your praises of
Simon Degge, the man is a nuisance, a sheer,
intolerable unmitigated nuisance.”</p>

<p>“Hear! hear!” resounded round the
dinner-table, in which Mr. Markham, rather
alarmed for his reputation, joined; and the
ladies rose, to retire to the drawing-room,
expressing their hearty approbation.</p>

<p>Simon Degge, meantime, did not trouble
himself about these wrathful comments upon
him in the neighbouring great houses. He
had the pleasure of hearing all throughout<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
Hillmartin, that the people there were highly
pleased with the check he had given to Sir
Benjamin Bullockshed, whose injustice to the
farmers of this farm had been a subject of
indignant comment for years. As his crops
grew, he fenced off what he wanted to secure
from the game, with a wire fencing, which he
found perfectly effectual, leaving a considerable
strip along the woodsides to the depredations
of these creatures. When the harvest
was got, he removed his wire-fence, and
allowed the game to wander anywhere, and
all autumn and winter he found an abundant
supply for himself and friends, who had thus
a great inducement to come out from Castleborough
for a good day’s shooting every now
and then. This was not less irritating to
the Bullocksheds and Rockvilles, than it was
delightful to the people and farmers all round,
who not daring to open their mouths, yet saw
with evident satisfaction this poetical justice
executed on men who had never shown the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
least sense of justice in their own conduct
whenever game was concerned.</p>

<p>The objects of social improvement which
interested Mr. and Mrs. Degge in Castleborough,
were introduced by them into the
little arena of Hillmartin. The condition of
the poor was looked into, and their distresses
relieved. Their children were afforded a good
school, and many a comfort flowed unostentatiously
into the homes of the aged or the
sick that was never known before.</p>

<p>Thus a new link was established between
town and country, which, though it did not
extend to the Bullocksheds and Rockvilles,
did extend to the Woodburns, the Claverings,
and some other county families. By the
intercourse of the Degges, the Woodburns, the
Heritages, and the Claverings, Sir Emanuel
and his brother Thomas, the rector of Cotmanhaye,
his wife and son, a very charming
little circle was formed, in which English
country life presented its most genial aspect.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
After a few formal visits and dinings, Mr.
and Mrs. Degge began by degrees, one or
other of them, or both together, to drop in at
Woodburn Grange unceremoniously, and the
Woodburns at Hillmartin. Simon Degge was
glad to have something regarding his farm
or country concerns to ask Mr. Woodburn
about, and to take a ride with Leonard
Woodburn when he went to superintend his
own farm. Sometimes they extended their
ride to Cotmanhaye Manor, and had a chat
with Sir Emanuel, or, if he were absent, with
the rector, who was a zealous farmer himself,
and rented a large farm of his brother, on
which his only son, Charles, resided, a couple
of miles off. They always found Sir Emanuel
extremely affable and even jocosely kind, and
always familiar with all the topics of the day,
whether political or concerning the affairs of
the country round. His peeps into the worlds
of the heavens did not seem to render him in
the least indifferent to or unobservant of what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
passed in this. He never obtruded the display
of his extensive knowledge of foreign
countries, or of men and things in the great
world of London and the nation at large, but
these were frequently showing themselves in
incidental remarks on the topics under discussion.
Frequently he ordered his horse and
accompanied them in their ride, and during
the winter he invited them to join him in snipe
and woodcock shooting, these birds abounding
in some swampy places on his property, as did
wild geese and ducks about the reedy back-waterings
of the river. On these occasions
he not only showed himself a dead shot, but
careless of weather and capable of enduring
amazing exertion.</p>

<p>The festivities of the winter brought these
families much together. Woodburn Grange
presented all the genial and gay abundance
of fare—fat turkeys and geese, mince-pies,
pork-pies, possets, and a world of light delicacies,
blazing fires, and country sports and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
dances, even blind-man’s-buff, turn-trencher,
and other romps, which had been preserved
at the Grange from father to son as essential
customs of country-life. These had a novelty,
and, therefore, a greater charm for the young
people from the town, than the more ordinary
dinner-parties and dances of the great halls.
Even Sir Emanuel Clavering became a laughing
boy again at the rural revels of the
Grange, and vied with the lightsome, butterfly
gaiety of Letty, amid these domestic
saturnalia. Sir Emanuel even opened his
house to several gay parties, and embellished
his handsome suite of rooms with a display of
arms of richest and quaintest workmanship,
caskets of ivory of most delicate carvings, and
others inlaid with jewels and gold, with silken
draperies of richest colours and strange devices,
and china jars and vessels, some of
stupendous size, and most superb forms, and
painted enamelings. He himself moved
everywhere amongst his guests, as affable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
kind, gracefully courteous and cordial, as if
he, too, never studied anything but to enjoy
his fortune and position as a finished gentleman.
Except his brother and his brother’s
wife, he was now alone in his house, for his
son was and had been some time abroad. All
were charmed with Sir Emanuel, and wondered
that he had spent so secluded a life in
the country. Perhaps the cause was not far to
seek, when it was recollected that Sir Roger
Rockville, the Bullocksheds, and Tenterhooks
had been his chief neighbours.</p>

<p>As the winter passed, and the spring days
grew in warmth and pleasantness, the intercourse
of these families grew too. Mr. and
Mrs. Degge would call and join the young
people of the Grange in their walks or rides,
and Mrs. Degge would drop in and have a
pleasant chat with Mrs. Woodburn, Ann,
and Letty, as they went on with their
different concerns. The great concern of
Letty, indeed, seeming to be to laugh and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
chatter, as if there were no such things as
care or matter-of-fact duty in the world. She
had to show Mrs. Degge the herds of young
ducks and chickens, the birds’ nests in curious
places in the garden, the dogs, and the
rabbits kept in the hutches, as if she had
been an actual boy, and to the evident delight
of their visitor, while a flood of intervening
small-talk produced bursts of merry
laughter, which, reaching the house, made
the graver mother exclaim, “What <em>can</em> that
girl be about?”</p>

<p>A great variety in this little circle was
furnished by the Friends’ family of the Heritages.
It was not the custom of these worthy
Friends to give festive parties, nor did they
frequent those of their neighbours, if there
was to be much worldly amusement, especially
of dancing, cards, or the like. They preferred
to make familiar calls during the day, on
which occasions they were always extremely
friendly, and as pleasantly cheerful as any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
people in the world, but always with a certain
substratum of gravity and soberness. These
visits were generally made by Mrs. Heritage
and her daughter Millicent. The mother was
sure to ask about what she saw going on in
farming household affairs. In winter she was
very much interested in Betty Trapps’s spinning-wheel,
which, when she had nothing else
very pressing, was sure to be humming away
in the warm, clean house-place, as it was
called, a sort of intermediate room between
the kitchen and the parlour, where the farm-men
and the servants took their meals,
and where Mr. Woodburn furnished them
with suitable books for their evening’s reading
in winter, but where the men generally
stretched their legs before the blazing fire,
and dropped asleep, and then stole off to
bed. Betty Trapps greatly amused the
Heritage ladies, mother and daughter, with
her country shrewdness and plain-spokenness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>“Dost thou manage to get good tow?”
asked Mrs. Heritage, one day.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” Betty said, “as good as I
expect.”</p>

<p>“Dost thou not expect it to be good,
then?” asked Mrs. Heritage.</p>

<p>“Yes, <em>I</em> expect it,” said Betty, “because
I look pretty sharp after it. They wunna
readily find a norp<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> in me.”</p>

<p>“Surely,” said Mrs. Heritage, “there cannot
be much cheating in tow?”</p>

<p>“There are tricks in all trades,” said
Betty, dryly, “and there are tricks in tow.
I get mine from Widow Pechell, in Hillmartin,
and as I scrutinised it pretty closely when I
first went to her shop, says Mrs. Pechell,
‘Ay, thou may look, lass, but nobody is ever
deceived in <em>my</em> tow, for they awlis expect a
bit of bad in the middle, and they are sure
to find it there.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>“That was candid,” said Miss Millicent
Heritage, laughing gently.</p>

<p>“But didst thou find some bad in the
middle?” asked Mrs. Heritage.</p>

<p>“Yes, sure enough I did,” said Betty;
“but I just took it out of the rock, and laid
it on the counter, and said, ‘Now, weigh it,
missis,’ and since then I never find any bad
in the middle, because Mother Pechell knows
it’s just no use. She may try that on with
norps.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mrs. Heritage, rising, “when
I want to buy tow, Betty, I will get thee
to do it for me.”</p>

<p>Betty turned her wheel more briskly at
this compliment to her sagacity, and added,
“You might do worse, Mrs. Heritage; and
yet I think Sukey Priddo can help you in
such bargains quite as well.” Sukey Priddo
was Mrs. Heritage’s housekeeper, and a sister
Methodist of Betty’s.</p>

<p>“Oh! Sukey Priddo is a good, careful,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
managing soul,” said Mrs. Heritage, turning
round and smiling as she went out; “but
not half so sharp as thee, I think. Farewell,
Betty.”</p>

<p>The Heritages, though they rarely gave
parties, were always glad to see any of their
friends at tea at five o’clock, and after that,
in summer, to a walk in the grounds, and
supper at eight, soon after which they liked
their friends to depart, as they had family
reading at nine, and all the house in bed at
ten. It was a hospitable, abundant house.
No good things of life were ever wanting
there, for though the Friends have always
been a temperate people, and have had a
horror of drunkenness as actually degrading,
they have always maintained luxurious tables—a
luxury wedded to moderate indulgence—and
have, combined with their avoidance
of agitative passions, the great and healthy
longevity they display.</p>

<p>At the simple but plenteous board of Fair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
Manor, our friends of Woodburn and even
of Cotmanhaye—for Sir Emanuel had gradually
been drawn out to occasional visits as
far as there, and seemed as if he could not
sufficiently admire the grave wisdom of Mr.
Heritage, and the oriental beauty of the fair
Millicent—have met quite another class and
circle of persons. These were inhabitants of
Castleborough, chiefly Friends, and their
habits of thought, speech, and opinion, were
a curious study to the more general denizens
of the every-day world. There was a tone of
what might be called practical and moral
economy about them. Their plain dresses
and simple manners were accompanied by a
mode of looking at everything so different
from that of the world—even the religious
world in general—as made it rather a piquant
study to those not intimate with them.
Having abandoned all the usual amusements
of society, as vain, frivolous, and often very
immoral, and, therefore, unbecoming true<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
Christians,—hunting, racing, theatres, balls,
concerts, cards, and other games of hazard, or
of skill employed for gain,—even abstaining
from music, singing, or other things which
might lead to lightness and dissipation, they
were thrown greatly upon trade for a resource
against <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</i> almost as much as for
profit. In the domestic life, books of the
most moral and grave kind, and the discussion
of the great topics of philanthropy,
of opposition to war, slavery, and political
religions, and plans for prison discipline, and
the relief of distress, and the spread of education
amongst the people: these were their
favourite topics; but of these their conversation
was of the simplest kind. There was
often a childlike character about it. In all
great moral points they were simple, direct,
substantial, and without grace or ornament,—grand.
Brave and able must have been the
man who could compete with them on any of
these heads, for they were on the rock of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
eternal truth, and no human force could push
them from it. Outside of this they could
find amusement in the most simple of simplicities.
You might see them at the tea-table
at Fair Manor amuse themselves—that
is, the young people, the elder ones looking
on—with endeavouring to lift, by a close application
of fingers and thumb to their smooth
backs, the small dessert or tea-table plates
which they used; or riddles and sober conundrums,
could maintain a very innocent mirth
for a whole evening.</p>

<p>There were, however, a number of curious,
and one or two remarkable characters amongst
the kind visitors from Castleborough, whom
we shall occasionally meet there. Not the
least striking figures in these parties, however,
were David and Dorothy Qualm, and
Sylvanus Crook. These were part and parcel,
as it were, of the Fair Manor circle. David
Qualm, as I have said, was the brother-in-law
of Joseph Heritage, Dorothy Qualm being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
Jasper’s sister. This worthy couple lived, as
we have said, at Still Lodge, just outside the
grounds of Fair Manor. Still Lodge!—a
most appropriate name. The very element
of David and Dorothy Qualm was silence.
So far as could be observed, they managed
to understand and communicate with each
other at the least expense of words conceivable.
Their movements were as quiet as
their words. What they did, said, thought
of, what was their specialty, no one had ever
been able to discover. And yet their specialty
was huge, prominent, unavoidable—it was
quietude. No passion, except it were a passion
for peaceful inertia, marked, much less
disturbed, their days. Their house was small
and modest, but always exquisitely neat. It
seemed a sin to tread on those bright, nice,
unfaded, unworn carpets. On the mat at
the entrance-door you read the large-lettered
admonition, “Please, wipe thy shoes.” The
garden was always neatness itself—staid and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
tempered in the very colours of its flowers.
Dorothy Qualm had once been seen ordering
the gardener to dig up and throw out some
gorgeously red peonies, as too un-Friendly
and gaudy in hue. David Qualm never was
seen to garden, to engage in anything active,
or visible even, except in tranquilly smoking
his pipe, and in riding out on a small, stout
Welsh pony, called Taffy, by the side of his
tall, portly brother-in-law, Jasper Heritage,
who rode, as befitted him, a large black
horse. The high and substantial apparition
of Jasper Heritage, and the little figure of
pony and rider inevitably at his side,
were familiar objects around Woodburn.
Their striking difference in bulk and
stature had inspired some wag to name
them David and Goliath. Once Sylvanus
Crook was greatly scandalised by finding
chalked on the wall of the entrance-lodge
where he lived, as he went out early one
summer morning,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p class="fs80">
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">David was a little man,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Goliath he was tall,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">And you may see them any day</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">At Fair Manor Hall.</span><br>
</p>

<p>Sylvanus hurried in for a sponge and
bucket of water, and perhaps never showed
more adroitness in his life than in wiping out
the offensive rhyme before his wife could get
a glimpse of it. But many an earlier riser
than Sylvanus had already read it, and it had
entered into the oral curiosities of Woodburn,
and even travelled to Castleborough.</p>

<p>In company David Qualm preserved the
same solid reticence, the same inexhaustible
capacity for silence as in his own domicile.
At home, his pipe was his constant companion
even more inseparable than his equally quiescent
wife. What was he? He was the
companion of Jasper Heritage, and that was
all, so far as the most inquisitive mortal ever
knew. Did he and brother Jasper ever converse
at home, or in their rides? No one
lives to tell us. Probably, in their own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
phrase, they were brought into nearness with
each other, as Oliver the Protector said to
George Fox at Whitehall, “Come again,
George, come often; for if thou and I were
oftener together, we should be nearer to each
other.” David Qualm, in his brown Quaker
suit, with his brown wig and his cocked hat,
with the ample brim suspended by silk cords
in the most orthodox style of that day of
Quakerism, was a figure to be carved in
stone, for no stone could surpass him in the
abundance and perpetuity of silence.</p>

<p>Sylvanus Crook, the lodge inhabiter—his
wife was the gate-keeper—Sylvanus, the
overlooker of the grounds and gardeners, the
house-steward, the purveyor of all necessaries,
and bearer of all important messages—in a
word, the factotum of Fair Manor—was a
middle-sized man of forty, of light build,
and clad in light drab, with short knee-breeches
and grey ribbed stockings. His hat,
too, was three-cocked, but had a less precise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
and more weather-beaten air than that of
David Qualm, but was generally believed to
be David’s, which in due course had descended
on Sylvanus. In mind, in manner, in all
else, Sylvanus, however, was the antithesis of
David. Sylvanus had talk enough and busy
mind enough for anybody. He read—having
the run of Mr. Heritage’s library, but foraged
most amongst Friends’ books: the histories
of their trials, persecutions, and the expositions
of their opinions. Sylvanus was a
sturdy champion of Quaker principles and
customs, and skilful must the polemical acrobat
be who ventured a wrestle with him on
that familiar and sacred ground. Many a
combat had Sylvanus and Betty Trapps on
the comparative merits of Quakerism and
Methodism, and on sundry topics besides.
Betty often turned the laugh against Sylvanus,
but he was like a true Englishman, as
described by Napoleon—he never knew when
he was beaten. Sylvanus was the indispensable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
man at Fair Manor, and was one of
those who, though servants, are acknowledged
as brothers, and was admitted frequently to
the society which frequented that great resort
of Castleborough Friends.</p>

<p class="center">THORSBY AMONGST THE WOODBURNS.</p>


<p>Amongst the Castleborough gentlemen who
were on terms of intimacy with the family of
Simon Degge, and who, therefore, frequently
was to be met at Hillmartin, was a Mr. Henry
Thorsby. This Mr. Thorsby was a young
man of one of the oldest and most leading
families of Castleborough. He was a manufacturing
hosier; hosiery being one of the
two great staples of the town—the other
being lace. These hosiers employed a great
number of frame-work-knitters in both town
and country. These people, in fact, handloom-weavers,
worked in the stocking-frame,
receiving the cotton from the hosier, and
bringing in to the town-warehouse their
woven stockings at so much per dozen every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
Saturday. A first-rate house, therefore, employed
some hundreds of men or women, as
it might he, for both men and women are
stocking-weavers, or, as they are termed,
stockingers.</p>

<p>Mr. Henry, or as he was more commonly
called, Harry Thorsby, was the son of a great
hosier, who had led a very free and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon
vivant</i> life; had been a fearful sufferer from
the gout; and had died recently from an
attack of it which had been driven to the
stomach. He had left only his widow and
this one son, who was regarded as one of the
most substantial burghers of the place. He
had large warehouses, a large and handsome
house, in which his mother presided, and to
whom he was the apple of her eye. In her
eyes her son Harry was one in a thousand;
never was such a handsome, good-hearted
fellow; he was, she said, as good as twenty
daughters to her, and always had been.</p>

<p>In fact, Harry Thorsby was a very good-looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
and pleasant young man. He was
something above the middle height, rather
broadly built, but extremely active. He had
a handsome, somewhat large face, of what is
called the oval contour, well-defined features,
a bushy head of black hair, a rather dark
complexion, and well-shaped black whiskers.
Thorsby, like his father, had a very sociable
and rather jovial turn—that was the rock in
his path. His mother, indeed, had often
with tears shown him that danger, and implored
him to take warning by his father’s
example, who had shortened his life by indulgence
in wine, and what he called good
company; and who might have possessed
double the wealth, and the first place in the
town,—yes, not even second to Mr. Simon
Degge,—had he avoided the snare of good
fellowship. Harry would not hurt his mother’s
feelings for the world, and he always
said,—“Oh, mother, you need not have any
anxiety on my account. I am not by any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
means fond of wine, though I do like a little
pleasant company; but I shall not forget
what I have seen, and I shall not forget you,
mother.”</p>

<p>Harry Thorsby was fond of his horse, and
followed the hunt. He might often be seen
during the season, in his scarlet coat riding
out of town on a fine morning to the meet of
the day, looking very gallant and happy;
and grave fellow-manufacturers as they passed
to their warehouses, while they nodded and
smiled in passing, said to themselves,—“Thorsby
will be Thorsby; what is bred
in the bone will never be out of the flesh.
Harry, like his father, finds something pleasanter
than his counting-house.”</p>

<p>But, exclusive of this taste for hunting,
and for shooting, which was equally a passion
of his, Harry Thorsby was a good tradesman,
and a steady attendant on his counting-house
and warehouse and business altogether.
Business over, however, he was much in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
company of the young men of position in
the town. He was an extremely merry, amusing
fellow in company; told an anecdote
well, and sung fairly. His nature seemed to
demand life and variety. He was extremely
excitable, but not to anger,—for he was
extremely forbearing under provocation; his
tendency was to pleasure, fun—what is termed
larking—and to all the jollity of youth.</p>

<p>One of these larks he often was very
merry over amongst his intimate friends.
He and his mother often breakfasted at a
small round table, and the breakfast was
brought in on a circular-turned mahogany
tray, which had grown rather rotund at the
bottom so that it would easily turn round on
the table. His mother being very fond of a
gossip, and having always a great deal to tell
him in his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i>, had scarcely began her
coffee when Harry had despatched his first
cup; unperceived, therefore, he would gently
turn the tray round, finish her cup too, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
then remind her that both were empty.
This process went on to the end of Harry’s
three cups, when he would spring up and
say he must be off to business. “I hope
you’ve made a good breakfast, Harry,” his
mother would say, rising at the same time;
“as for me, I don’t know how it is, but I feel
neither fuller nor fatter.”</p>

<p>Harry went laughing slily to himself away,
saying, “Well, mother, you have been amusing
me with your talk so much, you don’t
know whether you have breakfasted or not.
Get some more. You’re never wrong if you
eat till you are satisfied.” And the old lady
would say, “Well, my lad, I think I must,
for I feel quite sinking.” And he would
leave her wondering how it was, but pouring
comfortably out another cup.</p>

<p>Another manœuvre was not quite so innocent.
Being sent, as a boy, on his father’s
Arab mare, on a disagreeable journey, he
dismounted outside of the town, daubed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
poor mare’s face and knees with mud, and
led her back home, saying that she had fallen
and thrown him, and hurt him so much, that
he could not go. His clothes being smeared
plentifully, too, added to the probability of
the story. But if Harry had any feeling, he
was severely punished for his ruse, for his
father, in a great rage, took the riding-whip
and gave the innocent mare, who never made
a false step in her life, a most unmerciful
beating, and soon after sold her. This fact
had reached Betty Trapps through Sylvanus
Crook, and she prognosticated something
awful of so cruelly artful a lad. Cruelty,
however, was far from one of Harry Thorsby’s
sins of manhood. He showed often very
humane feeling.</p>

<p>Thorsby was frequently at Hillmartin;
and there was a belief that he aspired to the
hand of a rich Miss Mountain, of Castleborough.
However that might be, he soon
had occasion to accompany Ann and Letty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
home one evening, and from that day was as
frequent and familiar a visitor at the Grange.
George Woodburn had seen something of
him at different times in Castleborough and in
the hunting-field, and there soon grew up a
great friendship. They made appointments
to go to the hunt together. George invited
him to come and shoot with him; for, besides
the game on Woodburn Farm, Sir
Emanuel Clavering had given George free
range on his lands; and in a while Thorsby
was on the most familiar terms at the Grange.
Everybody liked him. He was so intelligent
and so full of the spirit of good nature and of
life enjoyment. He often came and passed
the night there, that he might talk with Mr.
and Mrs. Woodburn, and sing a variety of
popular airs with Letty, which Ann accompanied
on the piano.</p>

<p>George Woodburn was a young man of
very pleasing person, but considered, by
young men in general, peculiar. He had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
been educated at Repton, the great Derbyshire
grammar school, where he had made
the acquaintance of the sons of the principal
nobles and gentry of the county. Henry
Clavering, the son of Sir Emanuel, their near
neighbour, had been one of his schoolfellows,
and they had ever since been great friends.
They had enjoyed together all the pleasures
and sports of country life. Clavering was
now away, and Thorsby was a very acceptable
companion for George. It was in the
country and at home, however, that this companionship
was enjoyed, for George could
never be persuaded to join Thorsby’s social
circles in town. George had a steadfast dislike
of towns and great companies. From a
boy there had been a certain gravity in his
character, combined with the utmost kindliness
of disposition. He loved above everything
the country and country life. His heart
and soul were in his profession of agriculturist.
In everything connected with farming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
and with the objects of nature lay his whole
happiness. He knew every creature, great
and small, that inhabited the fields; their
haunts and habits were as familiar to him as
the doings in his own family. Every species
of insect was known to him, and might be
said to be loved by him. As a boy he could
tell you not only of every bird that built in
the hedges, the orchard-trees, the cart-sheds,
and the eaves, but the mason-bees that built
in the old garden-wall he could show you
passing in and out, and name them by names
of his own, knowing every one individually.</p>

<p>He had from a mere lad accustomed himself
to exposure to all kinds of weather, hot
or cold, to battle with the wildest snows in
looking after the sheep, to the most drenching
rains, following the plough, or carting out
compost for the land. There was no kind of
manual labour on the farm in which he was
not as expert as any labourer or farm-servant
of them all. No one could beat him in mowing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
reaping, ploughing, threshing, or in any
kind of work. He could plash a hedge, cut a
ditch or a drain, or fell a tree with any of
them. His strength was prodigious, from
constant exercise, and from absence of any
enfeebling indulgence, for he had an innate
aversion to much wine or beer, preferring
what he called the mother and staple of all
drinks—the crystal daughter of the rock.</p>

<p>In these respects George Woodburn was a
most beneficial companion for Harry Thorsby,
for George’s unequivocal dislike of anything
dissipated, his equally unmistakeable enjoyment
of the simplest pleasures of the country,
struck Thorsby with wonder; and when he
saw George’s real pleasure in the moderate
number of friends that he mixed with, and
his enormous capacity for enduring exertion,
he wondered the more. In their shooting
excursions he would have tired down a
horse, and never appeared to know what
fatigue was in himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span></p>

<p>“George,” said Thorsby, “how I do envy
you your philosophical contempt for the pleasures
of gay society, for you seem to enjoy
what you do like with such a genuine gusto.”</p>

<p>“But it is no merit, my dear fellow,”
George would reply; “for all those things
that you call jollities and gaieties are my aversion.
To spring out of bed on a summer’s
morning, and see the sun shining over the
beauteous landscape, steaming and smoking
in the ascending dew; to hear the cuckoo
calling me in her quaint foreign tongue, the
thrushes and blackbirds shouting out their
delight, some scores of them, as if they had
not hearts big enough for their joy; to hear
all the varied sounds of life, from the larks in
the sky, from the creatures in the yard; to
see the cattle and the flocks all luxuriating in
the green or golden fields; to hear human
voices making up the concert of nature, and,
above all, the merry tongue of Letty, and the
grave, loving tones of Ann, already out in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
the garden; to mount my horse, and ride
away through fields and woods amid all the
gladness of heaven and earth; to feel the
fulness of life beating in my veins and gushing
through my heart—Ah! what are all your
simpering fine people, and your candle-light
companies to me! Thorsby, I see men solitarily
passing their lives in the lonely fields,
or felling and fagoting in the lonely woods,
whose very existence will never be known
beyond their own hamlet; and do you think
they are miserable? I tell you, no—so long
as they can earn a decent reward for their
labour. I often talk with these men, the
Crusoes of the fields, of whom you fine people
never think, or value them more than the sheep
which graze beside them, and I find that God
has breathed into them, frequently, in His
silent language, of the sun, the moon, and
stars, of the whispering breezes of evening,
the colours of the sky, and the odours of turf
and forest—things the haunters of crowds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
and lamplit festivities never dream of. These
humble creatures, amid all their ignorance, in
all their unvalued life, go home at night to
loving hearts, and taste a happiness in communion
with a few loved objects, which never
can come to those whose affections are dissipated
by running over countless forms and
faces without settling on any. I would
rather be one of these poor, despised, unknown,
uncared-for creatures than the finest,
wealthiest man or woman who lives the mere
life of fashion and conventionalism.</p>

</div>

<p>Had George Woodburn been an austere or
moping sort of young man, such conversations
as these would not have surprised Harry
Thorsby; but when he saw, that in everything
George Woodburn found a pleasure as
fresh as a mountain spring, that he was at
home in the evening, all fun and playfulness,
with his sisters, listened with delight to their
music and singing, though he took no share
in these things himself; with what sound
sense and early wisdom he entered into the
conversation with his parents and friends on
any topic of domestic or public concern, he
was deeply struck by it, and entertained a
profound respect and esteem for so uncommon
a specimen of modern youth.</p>

<p>There was one person, however, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
Woodburn Grange family, who looked on the
introduction of Harry Thorsby on so familiar
a footing as a real misfortune, and that was
Betty Trapps. From the first moment of his
entering the house, she regarded him with a
cold and unwelcome eye. “Well,” said she,
when asked whether she did not think him
a very pleasant man, “he is not one of my
men. I say, if I must speak my mind,
dunna put much faith in him. Beware, I
say, beware of cockatrices.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Betty!” exclaimed the stern Ann,
“how can you be so uncharitable? Mr.
Thorsby is a most respectable gentleman,
known to be so to all Castleborough. Surely
a friend of the Degges and of the Heritages
cannot be a very bad man.”</p>

<p>“I did not say he was a bad man,” said
Betty. “I only said he wasna one of my
sort.”</p>

<p>“Why no,” said Letty, indignantly, “he
is not a Methodist; but for all that, it does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
not follow that he is a cockatrice. What do
you mean by cockatrices?”</p>

<p>“Ah! Miss Letty, beware! beware!” said
Betty, looking very serious. “I say not to
your young fluttering heart more, nor to any
one else. I see a great candle and a little,
pretty, very pretty moth, a-flying round it.
If it burns its wings, then it won’t be the
fault of Betty Trapps.”</p>

<p>Letty laughed outright. “Why, Betty,
you are growing prophetic; but what about
the cockatrices? I have often heard of such
nondescripts, but I never saw one yet.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure of that,” said Betty.
“If you have not I wish you never may.
But as to this Thorsby, he crows when he
laughs. He crows and chuckles, and shakes
those black locks of his. Oh! he is too full
of wild fire by half. See if it dunna run
clean away with him one of these days.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">“‘A crowing hen and crowing men,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.75em;">Twist off their heads and sleep again.’”</span><br>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<p>“Betty!” said Ann, “what do you mean
with your superstitious rhymes? Would
you twist off Mr. Thorsby’s head?”</p>

<p>“Oh no!” said Betty. “I would not
twist off his head; I’d only turn it hind
before, that when he thought he was coming
here he might be going somewhere else. I
would not trust him or his head. I only
mean that crowing hens and crowing men
are out of natur. There’s no sureness of
’em. Mark! I don’t say there’s any
guillery in this young man; but he’s no stop
in him.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the young ladies, “we hope
you and Mr. Thorsby will become better
friends as you get to know one another
better. He thinks very much of you,
Betty.”</p>

<p>Betty shook her head. “I’ve said my
say,” she rejoined. “What must be, must
be. It’s none of my doings nor shapings.
Pray God all come out right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span></p>

<p>Thorsby was always very affable and very
pleasantly jocose with Betty. Of course, he
was not apprised of her unfavourable idea of
him; but he saw that she did not willingly
converse with him, but then he knew that
she was reckoned an oddity, and he thought
it her way. As time went on Betty seemed
to soften down a little. He frequently offered
her money when he had been staying there;
but she would never take it. “It is for the
trouble I give it you, Betty,” said Thorsby.</p>

<p>“You give me no trouble,” answered
Betty. “I have just the same to cook and to
do whether you are here or aren’t here. You
can give it to Thomasin”—the other maid.</p>

<p>Thorsby found the very way to call Betty
out was to give her a little wipe about Methodism,
when she was sure to take up cudgels,
as she called it, on that point; but this did
not seem to raise Mr. Thorsby in her favour.</p>

<p>As time went on the intimacy of this little
circle of families increased. Sometimes Sir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
Emanuel rode up to the Grange, and after
chatting for an hour with the ladies, and
walking with them round their garden,
noticing their trees and young broods of
different feathered stock, and telling them an
anecdote of his foreign sojourns, and then
carrying off the ever-ready Letty for a ride,
and picking up, perhaps, Miss Heritage by
the way, he would invite a number of them,
and their parents, brothers, and sisters, to
come up and spend an evening, and see the
wonders of the heavens through his great
telescope in the tower. Advancing spring
and summer drew the young people out to
rides and walks through the fields and woods,
and to boat sails on the river. Summer
made all busy at the Grange: the swarming
of bees, the making of cheese and butter, the
labourers all engaged in weeding the green
corn, and coming in in troops for plentiful
dinners and suppers, kept Betty Trapps in
constant action, and in nimble bandying of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
country wit with these workpeople. Betty
sat at table and carved for them, and dealt
out sly hits to one or another as she dealt
out plates well-heaped with boiled beef or
bacon, and plenty of broad beans, cabbage,
and other vegetables. There was often more
genuine wit and humour circulating amongst
these sons of the soil than illumines the
boards of very great men.</p>

<p>“Ah! you there, Joe Clay,” cried Betty,
“let me give you some more greens.”</p>

<p>“O! no more greens, thank you,” said
Joe ruefully, “but a little more cabbage if
you please, Betty.”</p>

<p>There was a loud burst of laughter, which
the uninitiated would not have seen the gist
of; but Joe Clay had married a Green, who
led him anything but a green life. Not even
Xantippe could have cut gibes with her.</p>

<p>“How’s your wife’s mother, Nathan Hopcroft?”</p>

<p>Nathan Hopcroft, a stupid-looking fellow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
shakes his head. “Th’ owd ooman’s stark
dead, Missis; and I canna bury her; an’
I mun ha’ it done.”</p>

<p>“Good rest to her,” said Betty, “she had
long ceased to know much of this world—and,
Nathan, if you canna bury her, you
know where to go.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“To the club.”</p>

<p>“Ay, I’ve been there, an’ said I mun ha’ it
done, but they said, ‘No, the coffer were
empty; I was very able to do’t mysen,’ an’ I
ar’n’t. Th’ pigs hanna done well this year,
and ar Jack’s rabbits has been stown—nothing
but ill luck. Nay, they wanted me
to pay th’ doctor’s bill.”</p>

<p>“What doctor had you?”</p>

<p>“Owd Doctor Drawatter.”</p>

<p>“What! him with th’ pigtail and powdered
head,” said Betty, “and that fine gold-headed
cane, and that smooth finiking
voice? My gracious! that such a fine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
powdery peacock sort of a doctor should
come to you, Nathan.”</p>

<p>“Ay, and what do you think he said?
When I told him poor folks couldna pay
doctors’ bills—they had enough to do to get
bread—he says, ‘Pooh, pooh, man! the
poor are the best off of any people; they’ve
got no dignity to support, like gentlemen,
and gentlemen doctors.’”</p>

<p>“There’s something in that, though,” said
Betty, “though you laugh at it.”</p>

<p>“Ay,” said another man, “if they would
na plague us wi’ lawyers and doctors, we
might do. There’s Lawyer Metthard been
selling up poor Judy Selston for rent, poor
old soul, and now she must end her days
i’ th’ workhouse.”</p>

<p>“Oh, drat that Lawyer Metthard,” said
Betty. “He should be called Meteasy, for
he’s only too easy to meet, and not so easy
to get away from.”</p>

<p>Betty’s sally was warmly applauded, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
was sure to be reported all over the parish.
“But, Betty,” says another, “pr’ythee give
me just a spoonful more beer.”</p>

<p>Betty, who was an English female Eulenspiegel,
though she never had heard of him
even in his English name of Owlinglass, and
often amused herself by taking people literally
at their word, took up a table-spoon,
filled it with beer, and handed it to the
astonished labourer.</p>

<p>“Nay, Missis,” he said, “I did not mean
to be so very exact.”</p>

<p>“Why, then, don’t people say what they
do mean?” asked Betty, gravely; “how is
one to know?”</p>

<p>The laugh went round at the man’s expense;
and Betty suddenly calls out to a
humorous-looking little man in a soldier’s
old red jacket, at the bottom of the
table,—</p>

<p>“Well, Tom Boddily, so you are out of
the House of Correction again, I see.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, Missis,” says Tom, who had been
shut up a few months for making free with
Sir Benjamin Bullockshed’s hares. “Yes,
Missis, and who should I meet as I was
coming home that very day, but Sir Benjamin’s
own self. It was on the Furze Bank,
where I had snickled my hares. ‘So Tom,’
says he, ‘you are abroad again, eh? I hope
you have learned, however, now to know
your own.’ ‘Oh yes! your worship,’ says I,
‘and a little of other folks’s.’ ‘Ah! thou hast
learned too much by half,’ Sir Benjamin said,
says he, and rode on, but suddenly turning
round, ‘Eh! Boddily! here’s a gate thrown off
the hooks. Can you tell me who’s done that?’
‘Yes, your worship,’ said I, and he looked
all alive to know. ‘Yes,’ said I, ‘I can tell
your worship. As Sir Roger Rockville says,—“It’s
either Bill Newton, or Jack Shelton,
or somebody else.”’ The squire asked no
more questions; but before he could get out
of ear-shot, I said, ‘Thank your worship for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
sending me to the Stone Jug for three
months; there’s better keep there nor at
home. I don’t know how I shall ever make
you amends, unless I come and dine with
your worship some day.’ ‘Dine with the
devil!’ he exclaimed, turning as red as
Farmer Winterwheat’s new-painted barndoor,
and digging his spurs into his innocent
horse—wishing, I reckon, as it had bin
me.”</p>

<p>With this anecdote of Tom Boddily’s, the
whole rustic company rose, with a great
scraping of feet and scrawling of wooden
chairs on the brick floor; and sallied forth
with much laughter and approbation of
Tom’s <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tu-quoque</i>.</p>

<p>The summer was now in its glory. The
elder-flower scented the breeze, the pink
wild rose waved in long sprays from the
hawthorn hedges. The breeze fanned deliciously
the hot brown cheek of the milkmaid,
as she sang over her milking-pail in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
golden-flowered croft. The lark sung her
lustiest and clearest strains over the heads of
mowers and haymakers at the Grange farm.</p>

<p>It was busy time at the Grange in the
hay-season. Besides several fields of mowing-grass
on his farm on this side of the
river, Mr. Woodburn had a great extent of
hay-meadow on the other side. This hay
they got up and stacked in the field, and it
was sold thence to Castleborough. Mr.
Woodburn and George were every day busy
with the workpeople there till it was done.
They had access to these great meadows by
a primitive sort of ferry over the Trent, just
below the Grange, to which a winding hollow
lane, betwixt high banks and hedges, led.
The boat, or rather punt, was capable of
taking a horse, but not a cart over: carts
and wagons they had to take over at the
bridge, lower down the river. Anyone could
pass himself over at this punt, by pulling at
a chain which stretched across the river, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
was secured at each end to a post with a
pulley. The ferry was known by the name
of “Wink’s Ferry,” from a man who once
lived in a cottage near.</p>

<p>When the haymaking was transferred to
the home fields, everybody in the family took
an interest in it. Letty took a part, and
joined George and Betty Trapps in tossing
about the grass, and making a sport of haymaking.
Wherever she was, there was
plenty of talk and laughter; and George,
who directed the operations of the workpeople,
often saluted her with a shower of
hay, from his fork, over her head, telling her
that she would never earn salt to her porridge
at haymaking; whereupon Letty would
appeal to Betty Trapps, whether she did not
work famously, and Betty said, “Why, Miss
Letty, your laughter is worth a day’s work.
I’m sure it makes me feel young again.”</p>

<p>Ann would come out, too, and lend a hand
soberly, but soon tiring of it and sitting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
down with her mother, who brought out her
knitting, and sate under a shady tree, enjoying
the scene. Mr. Woodburn was leisurely
at work, too; stopping, every now and then,
to lean on his rake or fork, and wipe his
brow, and calling to his wife and the girls
to come and look at a mouse-nest, with a
number of sleek young ones all in motion,
or to share the honey of some little colony
of humble-bees, clustered up in its brown
cells not unlike a round bunch of grapes.</p>

<p>The last day of haymaking was always a
sort of haymaking fête at Woodburn Grange.
A tent was pitched under a huge-spreading
oak-tree, in a pretty hilly field opposite to
the house. A number of young people of
the neighbourhood were invited to dine in
the tent in rural fashion, and also to take
tea, if the weather was warm, on the grass in
front. On this occasion there appeared on
the ground, Miss Millicent Heritage, under the
guardianship of her mother; and Sylvanus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
Crook drove them thither, and was to assist
at the haymaking, which he liked. With
them came also a new acquaintance, at least
to the Woodburns; for he was an old friend
of the Heritages. This was a fair, amiable-looking
young man, who bore, however, the
learned title of Dr. Frank Leroy, and whom
they had all heard of as a young Quaker
physician of Castleborough, who had a very
great reputation for talent, and for skill in
his profession, having obtained diplomas, with
testimonials of the highest kind, from two or
three English as well as from foreign schools
of medicine. Any one looking at him at
that time of day wondered where the signs
of Quakerdom were, for he dressed and spoke
like any other gentleman. There was nothing,
either, very learned or formidable in his appearance.
He was courteous, agreeable in his
manners, and, as a stranger, somewhat retiring.
He soon, however, became animated on
joining the other young people, seized a fork,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
and set manfully to work; and the group,
full of merriment and sport, were soon reinforced
by Harry Thorsby, overflowing with
life and frolic. Our company being collected,
we will take a closer view of the rural gathering
in another chapter.</p>

<p class="center">THE HAY-FIELD FÊTE.</p>


<p>Scarcely were the young amateur haymakers,
who, by-the-by, were furnished with
light forks and rakes suited to such delicate
hands as those of the ladies—scarcely were
all engaged in raking and throwing up the
hay into wainrow under the generalship of
George Woodburn, with much mutual merriment
over one another’s awkwardness, and
over Thorsby’s mercurial capers and flourishes—when
a novel sight arrested their
attention, and brought them all to a full
stand. It was a long procession of the
labourers, each carrying a dish, and marshalled
and watched over by Betty Trapps.
The men had finished their own dinners in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
the house, and were now, on the return to
the field, made the bearers of the viands for
the gentry. Clumsy as such Ganymedes
might be supposed, they had in their time
been often employed to carry eggs and young
lambs, as well as most of them babies, and
they executed their task without a single
stumble; and soon, according to custom, a
horn was sonorously blown at the tent-door
to call the party to dinner. All came trooping
in free array, like a happy flock of pigeons
dropping down to their barley at the barndoor.
There were no leadings-in of ladies,
but all came laughing and chatting amongst
each other, and found an excellent dinner
awaiting them. I shall not chronicle the
courses; my readers can imagine all sorts
of delicacies, to which the merry troop, seating
themselves without any regard to precedence,
seemed ready to do ample justice.
Somehow, however, Dr. Leroy happened to
find his seat at the elbow of Miss Millicent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
Heritage, beaming with radiance of youth
and beauty from beneath those jetty eye-lashes;
Harry Thorsby, by an equal chance,
sate close to Letty, whose fair, fresh, heart-lit
features cast a sunshine round her; and
George, the grave but genial George Woodburn,
occupied a place betwixt Mr. and Mrs.
Degge, to whom he could show all attention.
Mr. Woodburn and Mrs. Heritage were neighbours,
and seemed to have much of interest
to talk of, in which Ann and her mother
occasionally joined, but what they said could
not be heard from the clatter of plates and
youthful tongues in full play.</p>

<p>Betty Trapps, and Tom Boddily, in his old
soldier’s coat, waited on the company; and
Sylvanus Crook, as something more than a
servant, had a seat amongst the guests. No
happier party ever dined under an oak in a
tented field, as Thorsby called it. It was
wonderful, too, to see the dexterity and
ability with which Tom Boddily performed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
his office. Ever and anon Thorsby had a
witty word with him, and Tom was never
without his answer. “Where didst thou
learn to serve at table so nicely?” asked
Mrs. Heritage.</p>

<p>“With my captain, madam.”</p>

<p>“Oh! thou hast been in the army?”</p>

<p>“Yes, madam, served fifteen years.”</p>

<p>“And wast thou in any battles?”</p>

<p>“Well, ma’am, I can’t say that I haven’t
been in battles, but none where much powder
was spent. I was in the militia.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that was it. Thou never wast out
of England?”</p>

<p>“No, madam.”</p>

<p>“And thy captain?”</p>

<p>“That’s the present Squire Chillington,
madam. I wor his servant many years
while in the regiment.”</p>

<p>“And how camest thee to leave him?”</p>

<p>Tom looked significant; a smile stole round
his mouth. “Well, the captain, ma’am, left me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, indeed! I hope thou hast not
offended him justly, anyway?”</p>

<p>“No, madam, oh no! not in the least;
but people may know too much, and it is
inconvenient.”</p>

<p>There was some laughter. “Chillington,
we all know, has been a very wild fellow,”
said Mr. Woodburn; “was it not so, Tom?”</p>

<p>“True, sir, true,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“Tell us a little about him, when you
were with him, Tom,” said Harry Thorsby.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Tom, as he continued to run
about, changing plates and attending to everybody’s
wants, “I don’t like telling tales out of
school; but since my old master signed the
warrant with Squire Bullockshed for picking
up a hare that I happened to see in a snickle”—here
Tom was drowned in a loud burst of
laughter from the gentlemen—“since he did
that, I don’t feel so tongue-tied as afore.
Well, it is true enough, my captain did sow
his wild oats pretty freely. It was a gay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
time, that regimental time. What with a
splendid mess, and fine horses, and dogs,
and fine”—Tom hesitated a moment—“fine
people of one sort or another, money did
go, though. My captain blazed away faster
than any of them. Wasn’t he heir to the
fine old estate of Beech-Lees? Well, it was
the old story: my captain wor continually
out at the elbows. Money, money, money
wor always wanted. The governor, as he
called him, that wor his honoured father,
after a while stopped dead short, and wouldn’t
out with a stiver. ‘Tom,’ he said—that worn’t
me, it wor my captain, he wor named Thomas—‘Tom,’
he said, ‘must live on his pay.’
Live on his pay! The pay of the whole
regiment wouldn’t have done for him. Well,
he used to write to his father’s steward to
send him money, telling him he should find
the good of it when he came to the estate.
And the steward sent him money for awhile,
but then he writ that the Squire had got an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
inkling of what he was doing, and kept such
a strict ferreting into the books, that it was
all up in that quarter. The steward remained
a good sum out of pocket.</p>

<p>“I believe my captain had managed to
borrow considerable sums of the Jews on what
are called past-a-bits, but the Squire soon let
them know that the estate wasn’t entailed, and
that was up too, and the Jews were as keen
after him as so many hounds after a hare.
As to borrowing of any of the brother officers,
they were all pretty much of a muchness, that
is, they were all very able to borrow, but not
to lend. There was only one of them that
was able to lend, and that was the Major, and
he had the unfortunate name of Need.”—Much
laughter, and loud cachination, or what Betty
Trapps called crowing, from Thorsby.—“Major
Need was always in need. You
might as well have asked fire of a fish as
money of the Major. He always pleaded
poverty, and said the mess was really so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
extravagant, he should get all the leave of
absence that he could. And you may believe
me, he did spend the greater part of his time
at home. And what was he doing? Why,
he was just as busy as a bee in planting
a vast lot of poor, sandy land that he had
with larch trees. There he was, while my
captain and the rest of the officers were
sowing their wild oats, always busy in sowing
larch seed, and having a lot of men at work
planting the young trees out as they grew.
There you might see this poor man, who
never had a penny to lend to a brother
officer in distress, riding away to his beggarly
land not worth a rent of a shilling an acre,
mounted on a sturdy pony, bearing a sort of
bag slung on his back, with his dinner in it,
and a big pruning-knife and a little saw in it
besides—going, he was, to prune his larches
as they wanted it, and keep a sharp eye on
his men at work. Well, I was that way the
other day, and bless my stars! what a vast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
of fine woods that man has, and they tell me
he is as rich as a duke, him that in our regiment’s
time never had a penny to lend or
spend.</p>

<p>“Well, it came to a sharp pass at last
with my captain. The lady asked if I had
been in any battles. Ay, troth, I was at
that time in battles enow, with those unreasonablest
of varmint, called duns. My
captain would have been awlis in prison if
mother nature had not blest me with a
good share of contrivance, and a skull that
could stand sharp acquaintance with constables’
staffs. Oh! if I do miss heaven at
last, it will be for all the lies I told them, for
my captain. How often I have sworn that
he was gone down to see his honoured father,
who was on his death-bed, when all the while
he was trembling in every limb behind the
door that I held in their faces.</p>

<p>“Once I was nearly sold. Oh, my gracious!
didn’t my heart leap into my mouth!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
Things were come to such a pass that something
very ingenious must be thought of.
‘I have it,’ said I to the captain. ‘I’ll hire
a coffin, and when they come I’ll say you’re
just dead.’ ‘No, Tom!’ he said, ‘no; that
won’t do.’ Then said I, ‘I give in, and
there’s nothing for it but the debtor’s gaol.’
Well, that cowed him. ‘Do as you like,
Tom,’ said he; and very soon I had hired
a good oak-coffin and gilt breastplate from
the undertaker just by. ‘Now,’ said I, ‘when
these fellows come thundering to-day, as I
hear they will—they swear they’ll break
locks—you just lie down in a sheet, and
leave the rest to me.’</p>

<p>“Well, no sooner said than done. I had
hardly time to lock the door, and compose
my captain’s goodly limbs decently in the
coffin, and put the lid loosely on, when,
bang! came the constables at the door.
Quick, quick did I open. ‘Oh, is it you?’
said I, sobbing bitterly, and with brooks of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
water running from my eyes, for I had a
famous strong onion hidden in my handkerchief.
‘Oh! come in,’ said I, ‘come in, and
see what you’ve done. You’ve broken his
heart at last. There he lies! Oh, enjoy the
sight—do, do! Enjoy the misery you have
made. Oh! what hearts are bleeding down
the country there for this handsome, good-hearted
young gentleman that you’ve killed!’</p>

<p>“I off with the coffin-lid—ghastly looked
my captain’s face, with whiting that I had
daubed it with. ‘There!’ said I, ‘you’ve
killed him. Your worrying had brought him
so low, he catched the typhus, and——’
Here my tears stopped my voice. ‘Fie!
typhus!’ exclaimed the fellows in horror,
and out they brushed. But it was nearly all
ruination. My captain, impatient of his
coffin, lifted his head before they were well
out of the door, and said, laughing, ‘Are
those scamps gone?’ Quick one of the constables
turned, ‘Didn’t I hear something?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
Didn’t I see something stir?’ ‘Yes, yes,’
said I, ‘you saw the wind from the door
blow the shroud up, and with it, no doubt,
the air of the fever. Ha! away!—it is as
much as your life is worth.’ The man
bolted, and for that time all was right. But
it was a very near touch, with the captain’s
impatience.” (Loud Hear, hears! and much
laughter.)</p>

<p>“Lucky for us, the regiment marched
next day, and my captain had gone off in
the night. But at our next quarters it was
not much better. The captain was clean
swept out of money, trinkets, and of almost
all his clothes. He had a gold watch which
his mother had given him. It cost forty
guineas, and that he had kept through all.
One day he said to me on the parade ground,
‘Tom, I have left my watch on the chimney-piece
in my room. Fetch it, or I shall not
know when to dismiss the men.’ I knew
very well what it meant. He could have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
dismissed the men well enough, for the town-hall
clock was right opposite to him, as he
fronted the ranks. I knew that he meant at
last to take it to my uncle.”</p>

<p>“Hadst thou an uncle living there?” interrupted
Mrs. Heritage.</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am,” replied Tom, drily. “Poor
men have uncles everywhere, and very kind
ones; their doors always stand open to them.”</p>

<p>“I am very glad to hear it,” said Mrs.
Heritage, in her wealthy ignorance of such
uncles, and amid the stifled merriment of the
young people.</p>

<p>“What I mean,” said Tom, “is, he meant
to put it up the spout.”</p>

<p>“Up the spout!” said Mrs. Heritage, in
augmented astonishment. “He meant to
hide it?”</p>

<p>Tom nodded assent.</p>

<p>“He meant to pawn it, he means,” said Mr.
Woodburn. “That’s his slang,” seeing that
Thorsby’s good manners were choking him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, that was it!” said Mrs. Heritage.</p>

<p>“Yes, that was just it,” said Tom. “I
went off with a sad heart on the errand, but
I soon had a sadder. When I went into my
captain’s room, the watch was not there. I
called the landlady, and said, ‘Who has taken
Captain Chillington’s watch away?’</p>

<p>“‘His watch?’ said the landlady, ‘why,
he sent for it!’</p>

<p>“‘Sent for it!—by whom?’ said I.</p>

<p>“‘Why, a young man, in a dark grey
livery and silver-laced hat, came for it. He
said he was Major Need’s man, and Captain
Chillington had asked him to come and fetch
his watch from the parlour mantel-piece, and
his overcoat from the peg in the passage.’</p>

<p>“The ground seemed opening under my
feet. ‘Did he say where the watch was?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ said the landlady.</p>

<p>“‘And the overcoat on the peg?’</p>

<p>“‘He did,’ said she, now all in a tremor of
fright. ‘He seemed to know so exactly all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
about them, that I never suspected nothing
at all.’</p>

<p>“‘And the coat’s gone, too?’ said I, looking
into the passage.</p>

<p>“‘That’s sartain,’ said the woman.</p>

<p>“I rushed out; there was no time to lose.
I ran round to all the pawnbrokers first; then
to the police-office; then to the town-crier. I
offered five pounds reward to any one who
would detect the thief; I did that on my
own head; I did not go to the parade—it
would have been of no use—it would
have been over—and I did not like to
break the news. When I came back chop-fallen
to our lodgings, there was my captain.
The landlady had told him all. There he
sate, dropped down into a low chair, and he
looked now more like a corpse than he did in
the coffin. He never spoke. I was horribly
afraid that he’d go off into an apoplexy, or
something, or lose his senses. ‘Captain,’
said I, ‘you’ve heard it.’ He never moved.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
‘Captain!’ said I again, louder, and shook
him by the shoulder. ‘It is no use sorrowing
or fretting, we must be wide awake to
recover the property.’</p>

<p>“Then he gave a great sigh, and seemed
to rouse a little. ‘It is of no use,’ he said;
‘that was an old hand, that thief. Catch a
weazel asleep, and shave his eye-brows. You’ll
never catch that scamp. It is all up, Boddily.
That was my last throw. There is not a single
stone in this cursed world left unturned,’ and
he went quite stupid and stony again.</p>

<p>“‘Captain,’ said I, ‘it is of no use talking
that way. We must be after the fellow, we
shall catch him before he leaves the town.
Faint heart never won fair lady. Rouse,
captain, rouse; we’ll have him yet, and all
will be well.’</p>

<p>“But you might as well have tried to rouse
a milestone. At last he burst into tears, and
he cried like a child, and rocked to and fro
in his chair with his face buried in his hands.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
He sprang up suddenly, and snatched a
pistol from the mantel-piece; I tore it from
his hand.</p>

<p>“‘Are you mad, captain?’ I said.
‘Would you go headlong to everlasting
destruction, and kill your mother with
grief?’ That seemed to sober him a little.
‘Cheer up,’ said I; ‘it’s an old saying,
“When things come to the worst, they begin
to mend.”’</p>

<p>“‘Never with me, Tom,’ he said, throwing
himself down, and looking the pictur o’
despair. ‘Never with me—all’s up. I’m a
doomed man—nothing prospers with me.’</p>

<p>“I could have told him why they did not
prosper, soon enough; but he’d enough on
him without any cut from me. As for me, I
was at my wits’ end. How should I manage
to keep him from laying violent hands on
himself? I was about to ring for the landlady,
and, while telling her to bring some
brandy, whisper to her to run for help—when,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
bang! comes a thundering knock at the
door. ‘Lock it, quick, woman!’ said I.
But even that did not rouse my captain.
‘They are there, again, let them come,’ he
said—‘let them do their worst.’</p>

<p>“The landlady, however, had opened the
door on the chain. Women are awlis
sharper about such things than we are. In
she comes with a letter and a great black
seal with a coat of arms. The captain
glanced at it,—he pounced on it like a hawk—he
tore it open and read. His hand
trembled, then shook violently—the letter
dropped, and he dropped, too. I caught him
in my arms. ‘Water!’ I cried, ‘water!
brandy!’ The landlady flew. We drenched
him with water; we tried to force some
brandy between his teeth, but couldn’t.
They were set as fast as rocks. At length
he gave a deep sike (sigh), opened his eyes,
and drank off the whole glass of brandy.</p>

<p>“‘Troubles never comes alone,’ he said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
beginning to speak. ‘The governor is dead,
Tom; we must be off to-night for Beech-Lees;
run and take our places in the night-coach.’
He tried to look as if the blow of
this news had been a stunner, but I could see
that it was huge relief. Mountains were off
his shoulders. The governor was past all <em>his</em>
troubles, and there was that fine old property
of Beech-Lees. I had no further fear about
my captain.</p>

<p>“‘But,’ said I—‘I’ll run to the coach—but
the money for the fares?’</p>

<p>“‘Oh!’ said he, looking about for the fallen
letter, ‘there’s money enough.’</p>

<p>“I picked it up, and another bit of
paper.</p>

<p>“‘That’s it,’ said he. ‘There’s no want of
money, now.’ It was a Bank of England
note for one hundred pounds. ‘Get the
Major to change it into small notes,’ he said.
‘He has always bushels of them.’</p>

<p>“I was running out to take our places,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
when I went slap up against a constable.
‘The carrion have got scent of the carcass
already,’ said I to myself. The next moment
I saw my captain’s gold watch in his hand.
‘We have found this,’ he said, ‘at a pawnbroker’s,
pledged for five pounds.’ ‘All
right,’ said the captain. ‘Catch the man,
and I’ll give you fifty pounds, and come and
prosecute the thief.’</p>

<p>“He took the watch. ‘That’s it,’ he said;
and put it in his pocket.</p>

<p>“‘But we shall want that,’ said the man,
‘when we charge the thief before the magistrate.’</p>

<p>“‘Catch your hare, and then we’ll cook
him,’ said my captain, now grown quite
cheery. The man looked as if he would
have the watch back to produce in court.
‘When you have the thief,’ said the captain,
‘you will have both the watch and myself to
produce; in the meantime, Tom, take this
good fellow, and give him a couple of guineas,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
for his present trouble; be quick, we have no
time to spare.’</p>

<p>“That night we were on the way; the next
morning we were at Beech-Lees. Soon after
Captain Chillington got married, and made
a thorough change in his establishment.
Among the rest, I went to the wall; but I
would not have minded, after all we suffered
together in our sogering days, if he hadn’t
signed that warrant of Squire Bullockshed’s.
That was a cut that will stick by me till the
day of my death.”</p>

<p>By this time, the dinner was over, the
dishes all removed, for Tom Boddily had
been rapidly serving and changing all the
time he talked. A splendid dessert was set
on the table, of grapes and peaches from the
hot-houses of Rockville, mellow gooseberries,
raspberries, strawberries, and cherries from
the Grange garden; and Tom made his bow
amid many thanks for his story, and withdrew
with Betty Trapps, to play his part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
amongst the wainrows. Great commendations
were heaped on Tom for his ability in
both telling a story and waiting at table,
and his services were not likely to be
neglected on fitting occasions from that
day.</p>

<p>Soon after this, Mr. and Mrs. Woodburn
and Mrs. Heritage rose and walked out into
the pleasant sunny air of the field. A soft
breeze was blowing, or rather breathing over
the warm, dry country. Mr. Woodburn joined
Mr. and Mrs. Degge, and Mrs. Woodburn and
Mrs. Heritage wandered up the field where it
was cleared of the hay, and seated themselves
on a bank beneath a noble crab-apple-tree
covered with green fruit. They appeared
deeply absorbed in conversation, and any one
listening might have caught frequently the
names of Sir Emanuel Clavering, his son
Henry, and of Ann Woodburn. There was a
mother’s care in the usually bright and
comely face of Mrs. Woodburn: there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
higher care in the noble countenance of Mrs.
Heritage.</p>

<p>“Then thou dost not think,” she said, looking
earnestly at Mrs. Woodburn, “that he
really does practise ungodly arts?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” replied Mrs. Woodburn. “That
is all the silly talk of the silly, superstitious
country people—that is, country people of all
sorts—for the farmers are as superstitious
as the labourers: and when Sir Emanuel
appeared at the hustings at Castleborough
to nominate a friend of his as candidate for
a parliamentary seat for the county, the
farmers set up a great yell, and would not
hear him, saying, ‘That is old Clavering
who deals with the Devil.’ But it is all because
he is a great astronomer, and is seen
going out at night to his observatory. The
truth is, as I believe—and a sad truth it
is, he does not believe in our Saviour.”</p>

<p>“Oh! how very sad! how very deplorable!”
said the pious-hearted Friend. “I feel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
greatly drawn to speak with him on the subject.
Such a very clever and agreeable man
as he is; and to be so far overseen. Truly it
is sad that this world’s knowledge makes us
blind. And his son Henry, dost thou think
he has instilled these unhappy sentiments into
him?”</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Woodburn bent closer to her
friend, and the conversation became still more
earnest and engrossing, but carried on in a
low tone, and with many pauses, and significant
looks and gestures, and not unfrequent
deeply-drawn sighs.</p>

<p>But the sounds from the tent below, which
had been hitherto those of a continuous
clatter of tongues, and of merry laughter,
now came forth in a chorus of singing voices,
in which the bass tones of Thorsby were predominant
amid the clear, sweet voices of the
young ladies. The tent was like a great cage
of warbling birds, or as Mrs. Woodburn said,
of happy angels. “Oh!” said she, “I do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
love to see young people happy. No one
knows what after-life may bring. For youth—so
a poem which I saw in the newspaper
the other day said—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">‘It is the time of roses,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.75em;">They pluck them as they pass.’”</span><br>
</div>

<p>“I only hope,” said the careful Mrs. Heritage,
“that they won’t teach my Millicent
any vanities. She is naturally, I think, only
too fond of music and singing; and thou
knowest our Society sees such a snare in
these things.”</p>

<p>“Oh! my dear Mrs. Heritage, Miss Heritage
will hear nothing here but what is perfectly
good. They have been singing only
Burns’s sweet ‘Banks and Braes o’ bonnie
Doon.’”</p>

<p>To the fair Friend, whatever might be the
moral qualities of “Bonnie Doon” was all unknown;
but the discussion was cut short by
the whole youthful troop issuing from the
tent, and going briskly across the field, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
disappearing in a wood that ran down towards
the river. Nothing more was heard of them
till tea-time, except an occasional call of a
clear, female voice, or a note of laughter, for
awhile, and then all was still. About five
o’clock, the workmen having their “four-o’-clock,”
as it is termed, amid the haycocks,
were seen bringing up the apparatus and
materials for tea, which was not set out in the
tent, but this time amongst the hay in front,
abundance of cushions being brought for the
company to sit upon. Once more the horn
was lustily winded, this time by Mr. Woodburn,
George having gone off with the rest of
the young people: and, anon, like Robin
Hood and his men, they were seen coming
gaily over the hill.</p>

<p>They all came in glowing with heat and
evident pleasure. Letty Woodburn looked
like a sylph, but a very rosy one, all light and
gladness, as if ready to fly away: even the
gentle Millicent’s clear blue eyes flashed a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
radiant enjoyment. According to their account
they had been taking botanic lessons
from Dr. Leroy, and had suddenly come upon
Mr. Thomas Clavering, the rector of Cotmanhaye,
fishing in the river, who had amused
them with a world of anecdotes about birds
and animals. He had assured them that he
had seen a jay with an audience of wondering
birds all around him on a tree, whom he
was astonishing by the cleverest imitations of
different singing birds.</p>

<p>Thereupon Sylvanus Crook said he quite
believed that. He was “quite satisfied that
birds sing songs of praise to their Creator
quite intelligible to birds.”</p>

<p>“But,” said Harry Thorsby, “they always
sing the same airs.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Henry Thorsby, it may seem so to
thee; but in my opinion, if we could understand
them, we should find them poets far beyond
many of our own kind. They do not,
indeed, sing about men’s actions, but of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
goodness of God to birds, and of the beauties
and pleasures of creation. Hast thou not
heard, friend Henry, of the Eastern Sultan’s
minister who knew the language of birds?”</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s a fable, friend Crook,” said
Thorsby, “an Eastern apologue.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” said Sylvanus; “but I think
that is a very beautiful observation of Izaak
Walton, the great angler; who on hearing
the nightingale sing, said:—‘If God gave
such music here to the wicked and ungrateful,
what will He give to his saints in
heaven?’”</p>

<p>“So you do like music after all, friend
Crook?” asked Thorsby, sarcastically.</p>

<p>“Yes, natural music,” said Sylvanus, and
Harry Thorsby was girding him up for a
regular dispute on the Friend’s objection to
music, but he was prevented by all seconding
Sylvanus’s quotation of Izaak Walton as extremely
beautiful, and by Mr. Woodburn
asking Tom Boddily what he had been doing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
lately, intending to draw out some of his
country humour.</p>

<p>“I’ve been a little on my travels,” said
Tom.</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed! where?”</p>

<p>“Well, I crossed an arm of the sea, as my
companion, simple Simon Grainger, called it,
and got into a country on the other side.”</p>

<p>“Ah! where did you cross this arm of
the sea?”</p>

<p>“At a place called Sawley.”</p>

<p>“Sawley!” said several voices at once.
“Why, that is on the Trent, Tom.”</p>

<p>“Well, I dare say it is; but Grainger, who
never was five miles from home, insisted that
it was an arm of the sea.”</p>

<p>“And what did you do on the other side,
Tom?”</p>

<p>“We were employed in getting gravel for
roads out of the river Soar with a machine,
and Grainger had a fine opportunity of earning
a guinea in less time than he ever earned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
a groat in his life, if he had had faith
enough.”</p>

<p>“Not faith enough?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Tom. “You see, a gentleman,
as he was crossing the ferry near us, pulled
out his gold watch to look at the time, and
let it drop into the river. It was quite plain
to be seen, for the river is as clear almost
as air, but it was deeper than it seemed.
The gentleman tried to get it up with his
stick, but could not reach it, and he offered
a guinea to any of the passengers as would
fetch it up. None of them would. So the
ferryman calls to us, and says to Grainger,
‘Old fellow, you’ve good six feet of stuff in
you; just jump in and get hold of the watch,
and there’s a guinea for you.’ ‘No, thank
you,’ said Grainger; ‘don’t you believe it;
I can trust God Almighty on the ground, or
in a tree, but not i’ th’ water.’ It was no
use urging him. ‘Stop a minute,’ said I,
‘I’m but a short ‘un, but there are more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
ways than one of roasting apples.’ So I
asked the gentleman to lend me his stick.
‘It’s not long enough, my man,’ says he.
‘Isn’t it?’ says I, taking the stick. I just
laid mysen down on the boat, stripped my
arm bare to the shoulder, and in a jiffy
I had twisted the hook of the stick into
the guard-chain, and up comes the watch,
and down goes the guinea into my pocket.
‘There’s not much of thee,’ said the gentleman,
looking at me, as he handed me the
guinea; ‘but thou’st got thy share of
brains.’”</p>

<p>Sylvanus thought Grainger’s speech almost
impious, not to trust God in the water as
well as on the land. “Ah! poor, ignorant
man,” said Mrs. Heritage, “his faith only
stops short at one point, and ours at another.
Is there not a limit to the faith of every one
of us?” she asked. “Would not Sylvanus
find a limit to his faith in some other direction?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span></p>

<p>“Ay, that he would,” said Thorsby, as he
lay kicking his legs about in the hay. “Let
him walk over burning ploughshares as they
did in the middle ages.”</p>

<p>“As for that,” said Sylvanus, “I could
walk over them readily enough, but I would
decline walking upon them.”</p>

<p>“Would your faith enable you to climb up
the church-steeple and stand on the weather-cock,
and turn round upon it, as a foolish
fellow did the other day?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Sylvanus, “there, friend Henry,
thou hast indeed found my limit. My faith
is not a foolish faith. I would not tempt
Providence.”</p>

<p>“Well, dear friends,” said Mrs. Heritage,
as if afraid that the conversation might take
a rather caustic turn, “I think the evening
warns us to remove. Dear Millicent, draw
thy shawl round thee, and our other dear
young women friends I would caution to do
the same. You have been warm with your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
little excursion. And here I would remark
that it is the custom of our Society on social
occasions, sometimes to drop into a little
solemn silence, in which something beneficial
may arise in our minds. I would kindly
invite you to such an exercise.”</p>

<p>When all had fallen into a silence, which
to some of them was a rather curious thing
amid the pleasures of a festive day, Mrs. Heritage,
at first in a soft and musical voice,
which by degrees acquired depth and earnestness,
said—“Dear friends, this has been a
beautiful, and to all of us, I think, a very
happy day. Let us not forget to be grateful
to the Giver of it, and of all good gifts. Days
come and go, and, however stationary we
may seem, we are going with them. The
bloom and gaiety of youth, beautiful as it is,
is evanescent as the glories of yon western
sky.”</p>

<p>At these words all involuntarily turned,
and saw one of the most glorious and gorgeous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
spectacles imaginable. All the western
sky was flooded with waves of gold and
purple, burning in and through clouds of
richest magnificence. An opening in them
gave passage to the blaze of the departing
sun, and resembled the gates of heaven
thrown wide, and, within them, far receding
regions of celestial splendour. All below,
under the effect of this intense radiance,
looked dark and mysterious, like a weird
land of cimmerian shadow that might hide
some mystery.</p>

<p>The fair speaker paused awhile as every
eye was earnestly fixed on the scene, then
went on, as if speaking the thought of every
bosom. “Truly ‘this may be said to be the
house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.’
What power but that of almighty wisdom
could suddenly put forth a celestial emblazonment
like that? What architect could design
such a wondrous and portentous portal to
imperial city or palace? What painter could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
suffuse it with hues and glories so divine?
Yet, such is the prodigality of the Omnipotent
Artist, who has sent forth, in a moment
almost, that glorious vision, that in a few
moments He will suffer it to depart, as if it
were of no value. We, or most of us, visit
the galleries of great painters; we gaze in
enthusiasm on the imitations of nature which
they hang upon our walls, and decree immortality
to them for their inspired achievement;
yet the King of artists every day spreads
before our eyes, and the eyes of the simplest
and the poorest, landscapes and aerial paintings
which no mortal hand can ever equal,
and no man lays it to heart. The peasant,
returning home at this hour along some solitary
vale, sees a picture such as no so-called
immortal master ever accomplished, such as
no king’s house can boast. Yet we feel
no wonder; we utter no praise. Behold!
and the marvellous scene is gone!”</p>

<p>All again turned, and saw but a grey, dull<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
sky, and below the solemn gloom deepened
into intense blackness. The speaker paused;
her fair, finely-developed face, seemed rapt
as into an ecstasy, still and passionless; it
was as if the inner eye looked spirit-like
through the outer, and saw deep into the
looming night of the western quarter. A
deep sigh escaped her, and with softer and
strangely thrilling tones, she said,</p>

<p>“I feel it, dear friends, laid solemnly upon
me to utter words which seem not to befit a
day of gladness. My spirit wrestles with it,
and would flee from the burden, as the
Hebrew prophet fled from the burden of
Nineveh; but a mightier, holier power compels
me, and I must obey.” A strange
shudder passed through the youthful listeners,
and Letty, greatly excited, half
sprang up and cried, “Oh, don’t! don’t!”
But George quietly held her down, and
put his arm round her, clasping her with
brotherly affection. The speaker, as if unconscious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
of the sensation she had evoked,
went on.</p>

<p>“Beautiful, very beautiful was yonder sky;
beautiful, very beautiful are the days which
have passed here. Dark, however, the gloom
which underlay that glory of colours. I
feel some of us, perhaps many of us, perhaps
all, more or less, baptised into that darkness.
We are passing deep into its shadowy regions.
We are pilgrims and wayfarers through the
valley of the shadow of death, through the
midnight wastes of blackness and despair. Oh!
thou heavenly and tender Father! extend
thy omnipotent hand. Lift us over the torrents
rolling through the deep, deep darkness;
bear us up in thy loving, unforsaking arms!”</p>

<p>The speaker paused, and sate still as a
stone image. Her eyes were open, but the
awed and affrighted circle could not tell for
their lives on what they rested. Again,
slowly lifting her hand, and pointing westward,
she said—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, ever-living, ever-merciful Father,
Thou dost lead us. It is borne in upon my
heart to know and feel that to all who hold
fast their faith, there shall be a safe re-issue
from the temporary gloom. Not a hair shall
fall from the head of any of us. Thou
wilt baptise us into sorrow, only to inspire
us with wisdom, with faith, with love.
Over that gloom of a little time, again the
heavenly glow of Thy divine pencil, the
radiance of Thy inner and inexhaustible
beams of beauty, shall steal abroad; and the
latter shall be lovelier, though more subdued,
than the former pageant. All Thy colours
of life shall be clearer, purer, more lofty,
more etherial. The after-glow of our evening
shall be more tenderly fair, more serenely
blessed, than our noon has been strong and
rejoicing. Amen!”</p>

<p>During the latter part of this startling
address, the eyes of the company had mechanically
followed the hand of the speaker, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
saw the colours of the sunset once more
travel out, kindle anew, as it were, all over
the western sky in most exquisite and trancelike
beauty. It seemed as if the inspired
woman had command of the elements, and
that their magic limnings followed the motion
of her hand; the soul within, however, did
but follow the course of nature and the
promptings of God. How often, in future
years, did every member of that company
reflect on these words with wonder, though
they now somewhat offended the sense of
fitness in many of those who deemed auguries
of evil ill-timed as the finale of a day of
youthful rejoicing. The speaker, however,
rose up, and, without any apology, shook
hands with Mr. and Mrs. Woodburn, said
“Farewell” to her young friends, and taking
Millicent’s arm, walked silently towards the
Grange, at whose gate her carriage and that
of the Degges were waiting to take them
home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span></p>

<p>All the rest followed in silence. At the
gate of the Grange Mr. Woodburn pressed
Mrs. Heritage to go in and take some supper,
but she declined, the carriages rolled away,
and the company dispersed. Harry Thorsby,
however, went in, and remained for some
time. But no one was inclined for supper,
though a very charming one was set out,
with abundance of creams, and custards, and
other rural dainties. Letty was in a state of
strange excitement. She appeared quite hysterical,
now bursting into tears, now laughing
outright, and at length sunk down in a fainting
fit on the sofa. There was great alarm
and agitation; but Mr. Woodburn said, “Be
quiet; don’t disturb her; only stand back,
and let her have air; she will soon be
better.”</p>

<p>“It is that silly, preaching woman,” said
Thorsby. “What does she mean by coming
here and croaking of all sorts of trouble, like
a confounded old beldame as she is?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span></p>

<p>“Gently!” said Leonard Woodburn. “If
no evil is meant us, Mrs. Heritage cannot
and does not wish to bring it. If some evil
does impend over us—for what mortal shall
say that he is insurance-proof against it?—let
us rather pray earnestly that it may be
averted, or that we may have strength given
us to bear it. But all that she means, probably,
are the inevitable trials that this life
sends us all. It is merely her Quaker language.”</p>

<p>By this time Letty had recovered her consciousness,
opened her eyes, sprung up, saying,
“Oh! what have I been doing? Why
are you all standing there, and looking so
strange?”</p>

<p>“My dear child,” said Mrs. Woodburn,
kissing her, “you were too much excited by
Mrs. Heritage’s sermon; you have fainted;
you had better go to bed.”</p>

<p>Letty gave a shudder, wiped her face, on
which the tears stood glittering, and said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
“Oh, why <em>did</em> she talk so! What <em>could</em> possess
her! Yes, mother dear, I will go to
bed.” She smiled, kissed her father, throwing
her arms round his neck, shook hands
with the rest, and sprang away upstairs,
followed by Ann—who was also deeply
moved—and her mother.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">A NICE SAMPLE OF FARMERS.</p>


<p>About ten o’clock in the morning, Harry
Thorsby rode into the farm-yard at Woodburn
Grange, gave his horse to the groom,
and entered the house-place from the garden.
There sat the whole family—a perfectly rural
group—George excepted. The ample bay-window
of that large cool room was thrown
open on the sunny side, and the sunshine and
shadow flickered pleasantly amongst the rose
and jasmine boughs round the window. On
the cool brick-floor stood a large basket of
ripe gooseberries, and Mrs. Woodburn and
Ann were busy clipping off their eyes and
stalks, and dropping them into dishes on
their knees, in preparation for preserving.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
Mr. Woodburn sat on the other side of the
circle, shelling peas—a job he was very fond
of—into a shallow basket on his knees, from
a large one on another chair at his side.
Letty sat on a scarlet cushion on the floor in
the middle, reading from some book to the
rest. She was in a white morning-dress,
and Thorsby’s eyes were first directed to
her.</p>

<p>“Good morning!” said he, pleasantly,
“all you very useful people. And you,
Letty?”</p>

<p>Letty brightened up with a rosy blush
and brilliant eyes, and said, “Oh, quite
well!”</p>

<p>“What, no worse for that Jeremiad yesterday?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!—why should I? As father
says, it was only Quaker phraseology.”</p>

<p>“Then I wish,” said Thorsby, seating himself,
“she would keep it exclusively for the
Quakers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I really wish she would,” said Ann.
“Poor, dear Letty was very much put out by
it. She was very restless and feverish in her
sleep. She slept with her eyes partly open,
and glistening, which frightened me, for I got
up, the night being light, several times, to
look at her, and woke her because she was
trying to cry out in her dreams.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I was dreaming all sorts of horrid
impossibilities,” said Letty, laughing; “climbing
over the tops of houses, and the like, and
not knowing how to get down.”</p>

<p>“Ah, there it is!” said Thorsby. “I shall
call and tell that dove-coloured Pythoness
that this sort of thing won’t do.”</p>

<p>“No!” exclaimed all the family at once,
Letty more energetically than the rest, “you
must not do that. It would grieve poor Mrs.
Heritage so; and there is nothing amiss. I
am quite well,” said Letty.</p>

<p>“Grieve poor Mrs. Heritage, indeed!”
replied Thorsby. “These canting, religious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
people, however, don’t care whom they
grieve.”</p>

<p>“I cannot agree to that, Mr. Thorsby,”
said Ann. “No nobler-hearted or more
humane woman lives than Mrs. Heritage.”</p>

<p>“I think,” said Thorsby, “they are selfish,
money-grubbing people, these Quakers;
and that there’s not much to choose between
‘the Quaker sly’ and canting Methodist.”</p>

<p>“Or a backbiting profanian!” said a voice
behind.</p>

<p>Thorsby turned quickly round, and exclaimed,
“Oh, Betty Trapps, so you are
there! eh?”</p>

<p>Betty had come in for a pie-dish from the
great cupboard, and caught the fling at the
Methodists just as she was going out.</p>

<p>“Ah! just in time, Betty,” said Thorsby.
“I’ve got a pleasant anecdote for you.”</p>

<p>Betty was moving off, without deigning a
reply, when Thorsby said—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span></p>

<p>“You know that your old acquaintance,
Molly Ayre, is dead?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Betty, stopping at once. “No.
Is it true?”</p>

<p>“True as gospel,” said Thorsby; “and I
want to tell you her dying sayings.”</p>

<p>Betty was riveted to the spot by the news
of Molly Ayre’s departure and her dying
sayings, for she had a great veneration for
dying sayings.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Thorsby, addressing the company
at large, “you know that old Sam
Ayre, as we familiarly call him, is a bag-hosier,—that
is, he possesses a score of
stocking-frames, employs as many stockingers,
and brings in his hose to our warehouse.
Molly, his wife, kept a little shop.
They were both zealous Methodists, and
Sam——”</p>

<p>“You might as well say ‘Samuel,’ Mr.
Thorsby,” interrupted Betty.</p>

<p>“And Sam, or Samuel, is a class-leader in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
high repute. Yesterday comes somebody
begging my mother to go to Mr. Ayre’s, as
the Missis was dying. Molly Ayre had been
a servant at my grandfather’s. My mother
hurried off. The poor woman evidently was
near her end, and was giving some last directions
to her husband, who sat, burly man as
he is, drowned in tears on the bed-side.</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ continued the dying woman, ‘my
dear Samuel, thou’ll find all th’ accounts o’
th’ shop right in th’ book in that drawer
there. There’s forty pounds owing to different
people, principally to Mr. Fairfax, the
grocer. Thou’ll see it punctually paid?’</p>

<p>“‘Eh! poor dear soul!’ said the husband,
‘wandering! You see she’s quite wandering!’</p>

<p>“‘And,’ continued the dying wife, ‘there’s
a good deal more owing to us. Thou’ll find
it all down i’ the book; and i’ th’ same
drawer a good heap of money in a stocking.’</p>

<p>“‘Eh! blessed, dear creetur!’ said Ayre,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
the tears streaming down his cheeks—‘poor,
dear creetur! Sensible to th’ last minute!—sensible
to th’ last minute!’”</p>

<p>“Oh, get out with thy profanities!” said
Betty, going out, and pulling the door after
her smartly; not even staying to hear how
Molly Ayre went at last.</p>

<p>The whole Woodburn family could not help
laughing heartily at this picture of human
nature, though they were afraid it might
reach Betty’s indignant ears.</p>

<p>“As to the Quakers, however,” continued
Mr. Woodburn, “I must assert that though
they are devoted to getting money, some of
them make a very good use of it. The
Heritages are extremely benevolent, and expend
large sums every year in adding to the
comforts and in promoting education amongst
the poor, both in Woodburn and in the far
greater field of Castleborough.”</p>

<p>“Ay, and they gather in plenty to do it
with,” said Thorsby. “Why, Mr. Heritage’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
gold may go out by pecksfull, but it flows in
by bushelsfull.”</p>

<p>“That may be,” said Mr. Woodburn, “but
it does not alter my position. Look, then, at
Mr. Dell. Now, he is a man who is not in
their Society, but he goes to their meeting,
and associates with them, from his sense of
their more thoroughly moral character than
that of most other people. There is a man
who is always planning some good for the
people. He has himself built and endowed
a free school for the poor; and has worked
actively in creating public gardens and public
walks in all directions.”</p>

<p>“And that intelligent and liberal man,”
said Thorsby, “can go and sit two mortal
hours, on a Sunday morning, in their meetings,
where not a word is uttered! Wonderful!”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr. Woodburn, “that is
rather wonderful; but then he tells me that
he takes the Bible in his pocket, and reads a
chapter or two, and meditates on it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span></p>

<p>“He might do that at home,” said Thorsby.</p>

<p>“He might,” said Mr. Woodburn, “and we
might and may leave people to their peculiar
notions of what suits them best,” quietly proceeding
with his pea-shelling. “And look,
again, at that brave old man, William Fairfax,
the eminent grocer and hop-dealer. Did
you ever see a picture of the great law reformer,
Jeremy Bentham? or of Benjamin
Franklin?”</p>

<p>“Of Franklin, of course,” said Thorsby.</p>

<p>“Well,” continued Mr. Woodburn, “there
is a great general resemblance in the persons
of these three great men, for I place Mr.
Fairfax in the scale of great men. They
were, and he is, of middle height and strong
build. They had, and Mr. Fairfax has, a
style of countenance with strong features,
somewhat prominent nose, and their hair
hanging in abundance on their shoulders.
Mr. Fairfax dresses, as you know, in plain
drab, with waistcoat long and with flaps; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
he may often be seen going about the town
without his hat, and looking very abstracted,
and with one hand thrust into his waistcoat
about half-way down.</p>

<p>“Now there is a man who, if he had had
the same education, or the same ambition, as
Franklin or Bentham, would have achieved
as great a reputation, for he has as great and
original abilities. It is lucky for Castleborough,
however, that his lot is cast there.
He has always stood forth for the good and
independence of the place without any regard
to his own interest.”</p>

<p>“But his interests have flourished finely,”
said Thorsby.</p>

<p>“True,” added Mr. Woodburn, “but not
the less true his daring and noble independence.
Awhile ago, Lord Middleton sent
his servant to say, that if Mr. Fairfax did not
vote for the Tory candidate for one of the
borough seats in Parliament, he would withdraw
his custom. ‘Tell thy master, young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
man,’ said Mr. Fairfax, ‘that I am not an
Esau to sell my birthright for a mess of
pottage. He is free to take his custom
where he pleases.’ His lordship withdrew
his custom accordingly, but he soon found
that he could not get served so well anywhere
else, and so went back to Mr. Fairfax’s
shop. But the most remarkable thing
is, that Mr. Fairfax has never paid a penny
of the property tax.”</p>

<p>“And do you call that honest, Mr. Woodburn?”
asked Thorsby.</p>

<p>“Yes, perfectly so, in his case. The law
was expressly stated, in the preamble to the
act, to be for the prosecution of the war.
Mr. Fairfax, as a Quaker, has a decided
objection to war, as unchristian. He could
not pay it; but he was quite ready to allow
the law to take his property for that purpose.
He was willing to suffer, though he could
not conscientiously pay the tax voluntarily.
Well, what was the consequence? Distraints<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
were made repeatedly on his goods for the
amount. Nobody would buy them; and
they were always bought back at the expiration
of the number of days prescribed by
law. At length the Commissioners sent for
him. William Fairfax walked into their presence
without his hat, and with his right-hand,
as usual, thrust into his waistcoat.</p>

<p>“‘Mr. Fairfax,’ said the clerk to the Commissioners—a
man of very dubious character,
I must say—‘Mr. Fairfax, what trouble you
give us. It is the law of the land, and you
must obey it.’</p>

<p>“‘If,’ said Mr. Fairfax, ‘Parliament passes
an act to set up Nebuchadnezzar’s image
again, wouldst bow down to it?’</p>

<p>“‘No,’ said the clerk. ‘I would fly my
country first!’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, the wicked flee when no man
pursueth,’ said Mr. Fairfax, quietly; ‘the
righteous stands his ground as bold as a
lion.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span></p>

<p>“Mr. Fairfax stood erect, grave, and without
moving a muscle, in the midst of the
circle of Commissioners, who burst into a
roar of laughter at the hard hit which their
lawyer clerk had received. William Fairfax
walked unmoved out of the room, and a few
weeks after the act was repealed. He never
paid a penny of it.”</p>

<p>“Then I think he should,” said Thorsby.</p>

<p>“I don’t,” said Mr. Woodburn. “I think
every man should stand boldly by his conscientious
convictions. Mr. Fairfax did not
care a straw about the amount of the tax.
It was the public of Castleborough, doing
homage to his uprightness, that refused to
mulct him with the tax and the costs of
the distraint. I could tell you many other
remarkable acts of this genuine Quaker, as
far from any cant or selfishness as Pole is
from Pole; but I see George standing with a
proposition in his face.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said George, “it is a most delicious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
forenoon. The air is blowing charmingly,
and tempers the heat. I am going to Hillmartin
and a little beyond, and I want you,
Letty, to mount Fairaway, and have a gallop
in the breeze. It is what you want to take
the dismals out of your blood. Ann, what
say you?”</p>

<p>“I say that I shall stay and help mother;
but, Letty, by all means, and Mr. Thorsby
will join you.”</p>

<p>“Of course he will,” said Thorsby.</p>

<p>“Your horse is saddled, Letty,” added
George. “I will have him brought out, and
so away, and get on your habit.”</p>

<p>Letty was soon arrayed in hat and habit,
looking as fresh and blithe as if nothing had
disturbed her nerves: and anon the three,
with Letty in the middle, were taking their
way up the ascending road towards Hillmartin.
It was, as George had said, a delicious
July day. Over the sky light clouds
were scattered; the breeze, soft yet fresh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
made the sun genial and not oppressive.
The wild roses wound fragrantly from the
tall hedges, and the light-blue buglos, and
the lighter-blue chicory—the latter with
flowers as if cut out of silk, and stuck
formally on the stalks—studded the sandy
banks of the wide heathery lane that they
rode along. The wheat-fields stood green,
but in full ear, and the convolvulus and the
scarlet poppy showed themselves gaily round
the borders of the corn-fields.</p>

<p>“I never see those flaunting field-poppies
now,” said George Woodburn, “without
thinking of that young poet Keats:—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">
<span style="margin-left: 2.3em;">‘Those scarlet poppies, which do bring to mind</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.75em;">The scarlet coats which trouble human kind.’”</span><br>
</div>

<p>“Ah!” said Letty, “but I think more
fondly of Ruth, in the ‘Ode to the Nightingale’:—</p>

<p class="fs80">
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">‘when sick for home</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.75em;">She stood in tears amid the alien corn.’</span><br>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span></p>

<p>That image of the faithful daughter of Moab
has given me a new and lasting charm in
corn-fields.”</p>

<p>“I wish,” said George, “some great poet
or magician could come and drive a little
poetry, or at least common sense, into the
old fellow yonder looking over his homestead
gate.”</p>

<p>“Why,” said Letty, “that is that wretched
old miser, Timothy Squance.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s Tim Squance, sure enough,”
said George. “Notice him well, Thorsby.”</p>

<p>As they drew near, they saw an old man
standing leaning his hands on the gate which
led into his farm-yard. He was in a dingy,
dirty-looking suit of coarse, grey cloth, with
black worsted stockings and strong laced
ankle-boots. He had on an old, slouching,
weather-beaten hat, and looked with a still,
half-imbecile look at the advancing young
equestrians. He made no movement of recognition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span></p>

<p>“Good day, Mr. Squance,” said George
Woodburn; “fine weather for the corn.”</p>

<p>“Ay, Master George, and for the hay too.
I reckon you’ve gotten yourn in.”</p>

<p>“We have,” said George, as they continued
to ride on. “But Squance has not
got his in; and won’t for this next ten days,
because he won’t pay for the necessary men.
There are his two great strong sons, and an
old carter working at it, that is all. Look
at his house, his yard, his hedges, his everything.
The thatch on the house is old and
rotten; his yard doors are tumbling down—some
have fairly fallen to pieces, and he
stops the doorway with hurdles. Look at
the dirt in his yard. Look at these hedges
of his, spreading out on all sides, covering
acres of ground. Look at these great bramble-bushes,
and furze-bushes, standing here and
there in his grass lands. And see what
rushes and blue wiry grass are growing all
over his fields of pasture. Not a penny will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
that man pay to stub and drain his fields,—they
are growing wild. He cannot see that
labour well employed is more profitable than
the sparing of it. His sordid, narrow soul
cannot comprehend such an idea. In winter
his farm is drowned and starved with water.
His house is unapproachable for deep mire.
In summer his corn-fields are smothered with
weeds and thistles and couch-grass. He
quotes Sir Roger Rockville in defence of
letting things alone—of bad roads and a
filthy farm-yard. He won’t put his money in
a bank or out at interest lest he should lose
it; and years ago he had his house broken
into by some canal-cutters, and had himself
and his wife tied to the bed-posts whilst they
ransacked the house, but the thieves found
nothing. It is believed that he has buried
a great deal of money on his farm, or in the
copses; and it is doubted whether his two
equally sordid sons even know where it is, or
will ever find it. Avarice has reduced his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
soul to the most wretched condition of
poverty and littleness possible for it to reach
and be a soul at all. He formerly had a
brother still more keenly penurious than
himself. He was so stupid that when any
one in the house—for the brothers lived together—offended
him, he would threaten to
cut his throat and go to America.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Thorsby, who could never let
a jest escape him, “no doubt he thought he
had to cross the Red Sea to America.”</p>

<p>“Those two sons of Squance’s,” continued
George, “never had an atom of education
but what they picked up in winter from
Howell Crusoe; and he said that endeavouring
to teach them was like trying to
fetch water out of an empty well. I once
went to the house about some sheep of his
that had got out of his fields—for the fences
were full of wide gaps—and were in a furzy
hollow, called the Dales, and were sticking
fast by their fleeces to the furze and briars.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
You should have seen the place! There sat
old Squance, just as you now saw him, filthy
in the extreme; his face did not appear to
have had any acquaintance with water for
years; his grizzly beard was coarsely clipped
with scissors, and looked like a rough stubble.
The house was half filled with faggots, and
he sat on a bench on one side with a billhook
cutting them into fire-wood. His wife,
not much cleaner or decenter, was cooking at
the wide black fire-place; and the walls were
all round black with smoke, stained with
grease, and completely covered with smoked
hams and flitches of bacon. The ceiling was
partly occupied with the like, and with
paper bags of seeds, and bunches of herbs,
camomile, horehound, sage, and mint, hanging
from it.”</p>

<p>“But remember, George,” said Letty, with
much merriment, “remember what a funeral
they made for that silly brother, who used to
talk of going such an odd way to America.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, to be sure,” said George. “The
coffin was put into the great waggon, and the
old man, his wife, and the two sons, sat
round it. They had managed to display
black for mourning, but it is believed to
have been hired at a pawnbroker’s, for it
has never been seen since. The waggon was
drawn by six great farm-horses, with all their
bells on their collars ringing and jingling as
they went.”</p>

<p>“How <em>can</em> people,” said Letty, wonderingly,
“grow so stupid about their money—what
good is it to them!”</p>

<p>“None,” said Thorsby, “no more than so
many oyster-shells; but, Miss Letty, it is of
no use your trying to comprehend such
people. Their ideas are as unintelligible to
you as you are to them. If they were allowed
to try a reforming hand on you, they
would sell your laces and your clothes,
put you into linsey-woolsey, and set you to
feed the pigs. Then they would think you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
useful; now they think you, certainly, a very
useless and expensive sort of creature.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I am glad they have not the opportunity
for such a metamorphosis,” said Letty,
laughing.</p>

<p>“It is the oddest thing in the world,”
said Thorsby, “is that wonderful fancy for
scraping up money, and denying yourself all
your life-long the commonest necessaries.
There is that old fellow, Woolley, of Derbyshire,
who made the town-hall clock of
Castleborough. That man once tried if he
could not save horse hire by employing a lot
of stockingers to draw his plough, as he held
it, for he had a croft in his own hands; but the
plough stuck fast at once in the earth, and
the old man left it there, exclaiming, ‘How
wonderful is the strength of a hoss!’ This
old fellow is a freeman of Castleborough, and
at the last election, coming to give his vote,
he could not waste his precious time in waiting
in the crowd at the hustings, but crept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
amongst their legs and came up by the table
where the candidate and his friends stood
taking votes. Seeing a very shabby-looking
man thus emerge from amongst their feet,
the candidate said, ‘There, my good fellow,
vote and away,’ putting half-a-crown into his
hand. ‘Stop!’ said the town-clerk, ‘that is
a very rich man!’ But Woolley put the coin
into his pocket, saying, ‘Every little helps!’
gave his vote, and disappeared.</p>

<p>“That clock which he made for the town-hall
is a very remarkable one; it goes a year
without winding up. When he put it up, he
ordered that no one should meddle with it
till he came to wind it up, and he took
the key with him. Weeks, months, a year
nearly went over, and the clock continued to
go. At last one day, the very day year, it
struck one short at twelve o’clock, and the
town-clerk sent a man off to fetch Woolley,
lest it should stop altogether. As the messenger
ascended the hill out of the town, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
met Woolley coming down. Having told
him his errand: ‘Fools!’ said the clock-maker,
‘I told them I should come at the
right time. It will go till one o’clock, and
it yet wants half-an-hour.’ But Woolley,”
continued Thorsby, “was a philosopher to
this Squance, for on being told that his
nephews would spend his money fast enough
when he was gone, he replied, ‘If they have
as much pleasure in spending it as I have
had in getting it, I shall be quite satisfied.
I sha’n’t haunt them.’”</p>

<p>“Oh! that is a sensible fellow, said Letty.”</p>

<p>“I am giving you,” said George, “a flying
sketch of our different neighbours in this
direction. See that tall brick house on the
right hand there; with this nicely kept
carriage-drive, and pair of handsome cast-iron
gates and new lodge. That is the farm,
or I should rather say now, residence, of Mr.
Norton. He has a farm hereof his own, of
five hundred acres: and it is called Peafield.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
Norton only lately married a fine lady from
the south somewhere, who has effected all the
changes that one sees here. Till her advent,
there was no lodge, no carriage-road, and no
carriage. Now there is a handsome phaeton
and pair of greys. Norton himself—you
know him, Thorsby—is a tall, solemn-looking
man, who had only the education that Woodburn
could give him; and was brought up as
plodding a farmer as any of them hereabout.
But this marriage has made a great change, if
not in him, at least in all around him. Mrs.
Norton, who writes notes on beautiful tinted
note-paper with the address of Peafield on
the top of each sheet, has had much trouble
to school her husband—now Squire Norton, of
Peafield—into something gentlemanly. He
shoots, and courses, and drives like any
gentleman, and really, when you meet him
in his carriage with Mrs. Norton, you might
suppose him some ‘squire of high degree;’
but unfortunately, like St. Peter of old, ‘his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
speech bewrayeth him,’ and Mrs. Norton has
continually to check him and say, ‘Oh, my
dear! not so—that is quite rustic—but so
and so.’</p>

<p>“Tom Boddily, who has both eye and ear
for the ridiculous, tells an anecdote which
excites excessive mirth in the evening circle
of the Grey Goose public-house. One evening,
he says, when he worked there, Norton came
into the yard with a lantern to see the horses
properly suppered and bedded, and went
into the barn to give out the oats for them.
Soon after Tom went into the house, Norton
came out of the parlour and says, ‘Run, Tom,
into the barn; I left the lantern on the
disappointment. Fetch it.’</p>

<p>“‘The disappointment?’ says Tom, ‘what
might that be?’</p>

<p>“‘Oh!’ said Norton, turning very red,
‘deuce take all these new-fangled words—I
mean the balk, man, the balk.’</p>

<p>“Tom comprehended in a moment. Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
Norton had heard her husband speaking of
being baulked on some occasion, and had
corrected him, wishing him to say disappointed.
Hence his jump to the idea that a
balk or beam was a disappointment in polite
language. ‘Well,’ said Tom, ‘was it that he
thought of the lantern, for he found the candle
burnt down to the socket, the hot tallow and
great pieces of red-hot snuff falling through a
burnt hole in the lantern on the straw beneath,
and in a little time the whole building would
have been in a flame.’ Tom, however, was
as unlucky as he had been with his captain.
Norton thought he was too wide awake to
the ridiculous in his schooling by his learned
lady, and he has never employed him since.”</p>

<p>“But it is time to turn homewards,” said
George, as they were merrily laughing over
the late education of Squire Norton, of Peafield.
“Ah! but here is another original.”</p>

<p>“Good-day to you, Mr. Woodburn,” said a
jolly, rosy farmer, with a broad, merry, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
humorous smile on his face, as he stood
setting wide his field-gate for a loaded hay-waggon
to come out. After a few good-humoured
words with Farmer Thatcher—as
they rode on, George said,—“Now there is
a man who is a man in his place, and who
does not want to be out of it. He is a
genuine through and through farmer, and
nothing more nor less. Honest, and genial
as the day is long; he loves a joke as he
loves his pot of beer and his harvest dish of
broad beans and fat bacon; but his jokes
are never at the expense of a neighbour, but
rather of himself. He says, when he wants
warm weather, he puts his flannel-waistcoat
on, and then, he says, it is sure to come to
try to plague him: and he goes out without
an umbrella when he wants rain, and it is
sure to come and try to gi’ him the rheumatiz.
He won’t have a blanket taken off
his bed in spring, because, he says, it will
immediately turn cold, and he should spoil all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
the crops in the country. These are his jokes,
for things really seem to happen to us thus
oddly; but the country fellows here believe
him in earnest, and say he certainly is the
weather-wisest man hereabout and far away.”</p>

<p>With such light-hearted discourse the three
found themselves back at Woodburn Grange
for dinner, which was set out, as usual in the
warm weather, in the house-place. All feelings
of sadness or foreboding had vanished.
Letty was as beaming and blithe as usual, and
Harry Thorsby was overflowing with fun. As
Betty Trapps waited at table, Thorsby could
not refrain from trying a fresh word or two
with her.</p>

<p>“Why, Betty,” he said, “you did not wait
to hear what a good end your friend Mrs.
Ayre made. I assure you it was very
edifying.”</p>

<p>Betty said she did not wish to hear Mr.
Thorsby jest on sacred subjects.</p>

<p>“I wish now,” said Thorsby, “I was half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
as learned as you, Betty, in the Bible. Come
now, tell me this: What was the reason that
Jacob on his death-bed, said ‘Bless the lads,’
but said nothing about the lasses?”</p>

<p>Betty was doggedly silent.</p>

<p>“Do you give it up, Betty?” asked
Thorsby; “do you give it up?” Betty still
maintained a disdainful silence, wiping a
plate very briskly with a napkin, and handing
it to one of the company.</p>

<p>“It was, then,” said Thorsby, “because
Jacob left the lads to bless the lasses.”</p>

<p>Jacob’s logic tickled Letty wonderfully—she
laughed aloud, and the graver Ann smiled
demurely, and the rest looked much amused.</p>

<p>“I thought it was some graceless ribaldry,”
said Betty then, scornfully. “Eh!
what a death-bed there’ll be somewhere, one
day! I wouldn’t be there for all the cotton
in Castleborough, for all the wealth in Lunnon,
for all the fish in the Trent.” And with
that, taking up the tray, Betty disappeared,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
and left them to their dessert, no doubt with
much aggravated ideas of Thorsby’s death-bed,
which was sure of coming some day.
That was her comfort in all Thorsby’s scorns
and jibes, as she called them, though she
would not have liked to confess it to herself.
On the contrary, she often made the pious
ejaculation—“God give him grace to see his
awful state. It makes one’s flesh creep to
think of it. That young man goes on tempting
Providence as if there was not a sky
above him, and a listening ear in it, that
hears and listens on as if nothing had happened,
and yet there is another dot gone
down in the great Book of Account. God
help him; I am glad he is neither kin nor
follower of mine.”</p>

<p>This she said to Ann Woodburn, who, in
the course of the afternoon, told her she
thought her quite rude to Mr. Thorsby, who
was very lively, but really meant no harm.</p>

<p>“No,” said Betty, “he may mean no harm,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
and yet there may be harm. There are
clouds as often hang o’er heads as never see
’em. I’m jealous, Miss, I am, and awfully
when I see such a squitter-witted thing as
that—a will-o’-the-wisp, as can only lead
into a bog, hanging about that precious Miss
Letty.”</p>

<p>“Miss Letty!” said Ann, looking
offended.</p>

<p>“Ah! Miss Letty; an angel, too good for
any such scapegrace as hasn’t sown even his
wild oats—only mere skegs, which are but
bastard oats. I’ve eyes, Miss, I have,” said
Betty, “if other folks haven’t, as should have.
He is clever, I grant you, is that young man;
but mark me, Miss Woodburn, he is all
fingers and no wrist. He is all pendulum
and no clock-weights. He doesna want
cleverness, no more nor a monkey, but he
wants sober sense, and grace more nor all.
I’ve heard of his daubing a poor dumb creature’s
face, as if it had fallen, and getting it a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
terrible beating. Ay, and he’d daub an
angel’s face, and ca’ it a devil, if it suited
him. He would black the devil’s boots for
nothing, while poor Christians were walking
barefoot over glass bottles.”</p>

<p>“Stop, Betty, cease!” said Ann, with
much authority. “Now you are becoming
malicious. I cannot permit you to speak in
such a manner of any friend of our family.
I—and I am sure my parents—expect you to
behave with respect to all who come here
with our approbation. Again I tell you, Mr.
Thorsby means no harm. I wish, indeed,
that both he and you, Betty, were more
guarded in your expressions; but you are
older than he is, Betty, and should set him
an example of forbearance.”</p>

<p>Betty was silent.</p>

<p>Betty was not more sharp-sighted than any
member of the Woodburn family. All had
long seen the intense admiration of Henry
Thorsby for Letty, and that Letty was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
growing strongly attached to him. But no
one, except Betty, augured anything but the
greatest satisfaction in the alliance. No
direct overtures had yet been made by Mr.
Thorsby; but his devotion to her was obvious
in all his actions, and in his constant
rides to Woodburn Grange, rather than to
his former favourite places of resort. Though
his gaiety, and freedom of speech, and fondness
for a little satirical mirth, at the expense
of her beloved Methodists, offended Betty
Trapps and others of her society, his moral
character was without a blemish: and his
social position and wealth, as shown by the
extent of his business, were all that could be
desired.</p>

<p class="center">THE FRIENDS’ PARTY.</p>


<p>A few days after came an invitation to
Woodburn Grange, from Mrs. Heritage, to a
party at Fair Manor. It was a thing that
created no little consternation.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Letty, “I cannot really go!
I dare not go for the world! To think only
of another such a sermon! It would kill
me.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Ann, anxiously, “you, at all
events, cannot go, dearest Letty; and I don’t
feel to like it by any means myself. What
are we to do? what shall we say? And how
very odd—the Heritages don’t profess to give
parties; they keep an open house, as it were.
It is very strange—what can it mean?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span></p>

<p>“It means,” said Mr. Woodburn, “I dare
say, that Mrs. Heritage feels that she left a
gloomy impression the other day behind her,
and she is desirous of effacing it by a pleasant
party at Fair Manor.”</p>

<p>“A pleasant party at Fair Manor! Oh,
dear father, how <em>can</em> a Quaker party be a
pleasant party?” exclaimed Letty, walking
quickly about the room. And then, laughing
in her usual gaiety, “Only to imagine a party
of Friends, who neither sing, nor dance, nor
play any music, nor any game but fox-and-goose,
or drafts or dominoes, and who make
such frightful addresses—being a <em>pleasant</em>
party! Why, to them a letter from a distance,
or a very dull poem indeed, is an excitement.
Think of David and Dorothy Qualm,
helping to make up a pleasant party! But,
really, it is a dilemma! What is to be
done?”</p>

<p>“I am sure I don’t know,” said Mrs.
Woodburn. “I would not for the world<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
offend dear Mrs. Heritage, nor dear Miss
Heritage, they are so good, and, spite of that
unlucky sermon, Mrs. Heritage is so wise and
remarkable a woman. I think, my dear, you
and I and George may go, and let Ann and
Letty be gone out. They can go somewhere
for a few days.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” said Mr. Woodburn, “I don’t
like that sort of women’s subterfuges, to get
out of a disagreeable invitation—they are
little better than falsehoods. I will tell you
now how it will be. It will be a very pleasant
and unique affair out in the grounds—they
are very pleasant grounds—and you
will see, Mrs. Heritage won’t preach a single
word. She means to do the kind and restoring
thing. We will all go, and be
jolly.”</p>

<p>“Jolly!” “Oh, dear father!” “Oh, dear
husband!” resounded all round Mr. Woodburn
from the ladies. “What an idea!
Jolly at a Friends’ tea-drinking!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span></p>

<p>Even sobersided Ann, as her father
called her, was excessively merry at her
father’s notion of a pleasant party.</p>

<p>“Why, dear father,” said Ann, “though I
admit that the Friends are very estimable
people, one cannot call them entertaining.
I think they are the dullest of people.”</p>

<p>“By no means,” said Mr. Woodburn;
“not half so dull as your genuine aristocracy.
Now, in my younger days, I spent a
good deal of time in London. I had introductions
to much high aristocratic society,
through my neighbour, Lord Manvers, and
I must say that duller society I never
was in.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! that is impossible,” said Letty,
all wonder. “Why, the aristocracy have all
sorts of amusements. In the country, hunting
and racing. In town, theatres, operas,
concerts; music and dancing, and the finest
singing, at their own parties. Their London
season is a perfect round and whirl of pleasures,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
according to all that I ever heard or
read.”</p>

<p>“But I am not talking,” said Mr. Woodburn,
“of their pleasures and amusements; I
am talking of their society. They give you
good dinners and good wine, I grant you,
and you have all that you say—music, and
dancing, and fine singing. You have great
crowds of fine and titled people of whom you
learn to know nothing but their fine clothes,
and fine jewels, and fine outsides. At their
more select and domestic parties—dinner-parties,
say—all is very outwardly agreeable,
polite, and even, to a casual eye, unassuming,
for such great people; but, my dear girls, I
tell you that, notwithstanding, aristocratic
society is the dullest of all society. Spite of
that seeming ease and non-pretence, there is
a world of real resting upon their own self-consequence
and greatness of station. Try
to break a little through that soft and shining
surface by a little of that familiarity which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
quite allowable in the middle ranks of life,
and you will soon feel that there is an invisible
but not impalpable division betwixt
you and them. It is what a clear glass
window must be to a bird that flies against
it, thinking it air. You cannot get beyond a
specious, arm’s-length acquaintance with these
apparently so modest and pleasant people.</p>

<p>“A country yeoman may say of the aristocracy,
as Northcote the painter says, as
regards his profession: ‘An artist may
honour them as patrons; but to imagine that
he can hold communion with them, on a
footing of friendship, is a moral misdemeanour,
for which he ought to be soundly
whipped.’</p>

<p>“Try to introduce a topic of more than
lightest and most gossipping interest, and see
the effect. Instead of the warm kindling up
of a truly interesting and ennobling conversation,
you produce a deep silence. So many
are the topics in those ranks, which, from political<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
and other causes, would be offensive to
some one or other, that all really important
topics are tabooed. These gay and speciously
pleasant people dare not speak their own
minds in society. There may be peculiar
and close little cliques in which they do; but
in my time it was well known that there
were not above three or four aristocratic
houses in London in which there was any
real freedom of discussion. You met at
many of them men of science, men high in
the Church and theology, men and women
famous in letters, but they were as dull there
as the rest. They smiled, and talked of the
weather, or of the play, but their deeper
thoughts were carefully locked in their souls.
No, I say it—that any one who long frequents
aristocratic circles, comes to feel a
heavy, dull atmosphere there, and is glad to
get into the middle regions to breathe life
and intellectual thought once more. There
is a science of dining-out discourse—the art<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
of talking without saying anything—and
those who are adroit at billiards may get well
through the long after-dinner hours. I have
been at many out-of-door fêtes. It was the
same. You had coveys of gay people—great
lords, bishops, princes even, great lawyers,
and great soldiers, and their ladies. Much
beauty, much collecting of gay equipages at
the gates, and splendid military bands of
music—but that was all. It is true what
Lord Byron says—</p>

<p class="fs80">
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">‘He who ascends to mountain-tops, shall find</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.75em;">The loftiest peaks most wrapped in clouds and snow.’</span><br>
</p>

<p>“I don’t mean to say that the aristocracy,
in their families, and the familiar
circles of their kith and kin, are not as agreeable
and as full of heart and pleasantness as
other people. I am now only speaking of
them in their general society, as you were
speaking of the general society of the Friends;
and, in fact, it may seem a strange fancy to
you, but I have always seen a great similarity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
in the manners of the aristocracy and those
of Friends. There is the same quiet, unexcited
manner—a repose that expresses no
surprise at anything. The women of the
Society, in particular, are vastly, in their
manners and deportment, like ladies of rank,
though so different in costume. Both one
and the other class can live in society on the
smallest possible quantum of ideas imaginable.
Look at the fair, smooth, unimpassioned faces
of the Quaker ladies! On those placid countenances
you trace no vestiges of the storms
of passion or the cravings of ambition. Perhaps
the Quaker ladies possess that tranquillity
of tone and temper which their aristocratic
sisters wear so admirably. Certainly I know
no class of people who approach so closely to
the aristocratic caste, as the Friends. But, as
to dulness, give me the Quakers rather than
the titled great, for they do indulge in topics
of the highest importance. On the means of
putting down war, slavery, priestcraft, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
political injustice; and on the means of promoting
freedom of conscience and thought,
peace, and knowledge, they will at any time
grow eloquent.”</p>

<p>“Upon my word, dear father,” said Letty,
“I never knew you were so much of a Quaker
before!”</p>

<p>“I am no Quaker, little quiz,” said Leonard
Woodburn, “but I like them as honest and
practical people. Do you know that William
Fairfax, of whom I was speaking a little
while ago, saved me seventy pounds lately?
I was passing along the street in which his
shop is, when out he came, bare-headed.
‘Leonard Woodburn,’ he said, ‘hast thou any
of Dakeyne’s notes?’ I replied, that it was
very probable, as I had lately received a
large payment for corn from Derbyshire.
This Dakeyne was a flax-spinner, of Darley
Dale, and on his bank-notes he had an engraving
of a flax-dressing machine, and the
motto, ‘Strike, Dakeyne! the devil is in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
flax.’ ‘I never liked that man,’ said Mr.
Fairfax. ‘If the devil was in his flax, he
was not the man for me. But if thou
hast any of his notes, get rid of them, for
he won’t stand a fortnight. He has many
paper-kites out, and they are beginning to
fall.’</p>

<p>“On returning home, I looked over my
money, and found seventy of his one-pound
notes. I paid them into Mr. Heritage’s bank,
who immediately, by his agent, paid them in
to Dakeyne, so that we might not be the
means of defrauding any other innocent
person.”</p>

<p>“Ah! now I see,” said Letty, archly,
“why you praise the Friends so.”</p>

<p>“Hussy!” said Mr. Woodburn, “that’s
the way you treat your father’s motives, eh!”
And he shook his finger in playful menace
at her.</p>

<p>At this moment up rode Harry Thorsby,
and soon came rapidly in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span></p>

<p>“Well, you won’t go to this party at Fair
Manor, of course?”</p>

<p>“We are all going,” said Mr. Woodburn,
with a sort of brusque jollity.</p>

<p>“You are?” And Thorsby looked silently
from one to another.</p>

<p>“Not Letty, though?” he added.</p>

<p>“Yes, Letty and all,” said Mr. Woodburn.</p>

<p>“Are not you a little cracked?” asked
Thorsby, gravely. “After what passed
lately—why, I can scarcely credit my senses.”</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” said Mr. Woodburn. “I
will pledge my wisdom that all will be most
innocent, and, I dare say, rather amusing.”</p>

<p>“<em>Very</em> amusing, I should think,” said
Thorsby, laughing. “Nay, then, if you are
all going, I am going, and I shall try to
make a little fun, if possible; but if I see any
sermon coming, I shall seize on you, Letty,
and run right off with you. But I can’t
imagine, for the life of me, how we are to get
through the evening.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, but they can teach you how to save
money,” said Letty, mischievously; “and
what can be pleasanter? That Mr. Fairfax
showed my father how to save seventy pounds
the other day.”</p>

<p>“That would be charming, indeed!”
said Thorsby. “That settles the whole
question.”</p>

<p>“We shall see what they will do,” said Mr.
Woodburn. So it was concluded to accept
the invitation; and Harry Thorsby was entrusted
with the note to that effect to leave
at the lodge in passing.</p>

<p>The evening of the appointed day saw the
Woodburns driving up towards Fair Manor.
Other carriages were seen approaching from
Castleborough, indicating that it was to be
a considerable gathering. It was a lovely
evening. The day had been cloudless and
hot; the earth was dry and glowing, for
there had been no rain for many weeks.
The air, as five o’clock approached (the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
early country hour fixed for tea), was still
warm and genial. “The weather is really
made for these good people,” said Mr. Woodburn;
“we have not the proverbial rains
and chills of pic-nics and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fêtes champêtres</i>.”</p>

<p>“And I think it’s made for us, too,” said
Letty, gaily. “I don’t think Providence is
partial, dear father.”</p>

<p>“Just so,” said Mr. Woodburn; “for as
you are inclined to be a little wicked, you
moralising chit, it fulfils the proof that God
makes his sun to shine on the just and the
unjust.”</p>

<p>“Oh! do you number me with the unjust?”</p>

<p>“Now and then I do, Letty; but, taking
you altogether, you are pretty well, I think.”</p>

<p>They were now entering the great lodge-gates,
which were thrown wide; and the
marks of a considerable number of wheels
showed that, early as they seemed, they were
far from the earliest. A sober-suited man,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
like one of the villagers, stood guard to keep
the little curious village children outside the
grounds, and out of the way of the carriages.
A little on, and you saw that it was a gala
day at Fair Manor, for the fountain in the
middle of the front lawn was playing splendidly.
The rich fragrance of the orange-flowers,
from the large row of trees along the
house-front, floated deliciously through the
still, warm atmosphere.</p>

<p>As they descended from the carriage at
the broad steps of the front door, what was
their surprise to see, standing to receive
them, Tom Boddily, arrayed in a plain, dark,
out-of-livery suit, who bowed with a quiet,
arch smile, but with a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savoir faire</i>, which
showed that he was at home in such an office.
Tom informed them that the company were
all in the garden, where the tea would be
served, and said the ladies were recommended
not to take off their bonnets. He led the way
through the fine wide and lofty hall running<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
through the house, and to the foot of the steps
at the other door, where, with another very
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au fait</i> bow, he pointed to a large canopy on
poles, on the lawn, where a considerable company
of guests were standing about.</p>

<p>“Now, there’s an instance of the quick eye
for business which even the lady Quakers
have,” said Mr. Woodburn, as he led on his
comely wife. “Mrs. Heritage saw in a
moment, at our haymaking, the jewel of a
serving-man in Tom Boddily.”</p>

<p>The next moment Mr. and Mrs. Woodburn,
and the young ladies, were received
with the warmest welcome by Mr. and Mrs.
Heritage, and Miss Heritage, the latter of
whom kissed Letty and Ann affectionately.
They saw George already there, and Thorsby,
looking all radiance with good spirits.
They were introduced to the different persons
unknown to them, consisting of a “mixed
medley,” as some people are fond of calling
it, of the Quaker world and the outer world.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
Amid the ordinary attire of those, in Friends’
phrase, “not in the Society,” gleamed the
subdued hues, French grey and dove-colour,
the dresses of a number of young Quaker
girls, in their neat little transparent and delicately-drawn
book-muslin caps. More matronly
lady Friends showed their dark-brown
or russet colour gowns, white muslin handkerchiefs
over their shoulders, and caps of
thicker fabric and plainer style.</p>

<p>Thorsby, who had already found himself at
Letty’s side, whispered to her, “Deuced pretty
are not some of these young Quakeresses?
What health, what innocence in their looks—and
yet, I can detect a certain arch wide-awakeness
under all their apparent simplicity.
And what an air some of them have, even in
that quaint dress—why, I can see that in
that gay unworldly costume, they cultivate—Fashion!
Upon my word! yes, it is a fact.
See the difference betwixt the dress of the
elder ladies and theirs! As for Miss Heritage,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
she is really bewitching. Why, in her
simple dark dress and little jaunty cap there
is an indescribable elegance. Look at those
clear, sunny, azure eyes, under those dark
eye-lashes, and amid that raven hair. I
don’t wonder that King George, in his
younger days, ran away with a young
Quakeress.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think,” said Letty, looking at
him with a funny smile, “that you will be
running off with one some day?”</p>

<p>“Never!” said Thorsby, looking earnestly
into Letty’s eyes.</p>

<p>But there is a call to tea, and the company
are taking their places, and we don’t yet
know who there are. I see, however, Sir
Emanuel Clavering, Mr. Thomas Clavering,
the rector of Cotmanhaye, and Mrs. Clavering;
Dr. Frank Leroy; a number of ladies
and gentlemen from Castleborough, whom
my readers would not know if I formally
introduced them. There was that William<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
Fairfax, the eminent grocer, by whom Mr.
Woodburn seated himself. There was a tall,
large, humorous-looking individual, a Mr.
George Barthe, a Friend and dentist, celebrated
throughout the neighbouring counties
amongst the aristocracy for his skill and his
droll sayings, Quaker as he was. Not far off
sat a middle-sized, thin, elderly man, of a
venerable but peculiar look, a Friend, named
Mr. Ephraim Wire, reckoned a very great eccentric.
Mr. Heritage, a tall, handsome man,
very gentlemanly in his manners, and with a
dark-brown suit of strictly Friends’ clothes,
yet somehow very little differing from those
of other gentlemen, was making himself
agreeable to all present. Mrs. Heritage
looked at once Quakerly and queenly, and
was as cordially kindly smiling, and courteously
hospitable, as if she never had
breathed a word of omen in any sermon, or
in any other way. She knew how to distribute
her attentions to every one, and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
make every one feel at ease and happy. She
saw all seated under that ample canvas
canopy, at that ample and luxuriously-spread
tea-table, where a number of urns, at equal
distances, were made the centres of attraction,
by being officiated at by very sweet young
girls in Friend-costume. Tom Boddily was
actively waiting, and conveying cups of
odorous tea or coffee with a dexterous celerity
which showed old practice. With him were
Sylvanus Crook, in his Quaker drab, and
another Quaker serving-man, the very counterpart
of Sylvanus, only nearly twice his
height and size. He wore a drab suit of the
very same cut as Sylvanus’s, grey stockings,
and shoes with large square buckles. His
hat was three-cocked, and the broad brim suspended
by silk-cords, exactly as Sylvanus’s
hat. He had a thin, somewhat meagre, but
knowing-looking countenance, and greyish
hair. His hat now was laid aside.</p>

<p>“Look at that Bunyan’s Christian sort of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
man waiting so solemnly,” said some one to
his neighbour. “That is the coachman of
George Barthe, yonder, the dentist; odd
master, odd man.”</p>

<p>Sir Emanuel Clavering and Mr. Heritage
seemed to be spreading a great deal of life
and interest around them by the conversation
they were carrying on. Mrs. Heritage, Mrs.
Woodburn, and Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Clavering
appeared equally at home in some pleasant
conversation. Dr. Leroy had again
contrived to be seated betwixt Miss Millicent
Heritage and a young lady—ay, who is she?
Thorsby, betwixt Letty and a gentleman unknown
to me, but opposite to Ann Woodburn
and this young lady, was just asking the
same question. Well, she is not a Friend;
and she is a stranger; and a very interesting
one. She is tall, handsome both in figure
and face. Appears five-and-twenty, and has
an expression, so clear, clever, well-bred, and
yet with a sentiment in her eyes, both of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
love, of mirth, and of something deeper,
that is very fascinating. It appears so to
George Woodburn, who sits also not far from
opposite to her, and has scarcely taken his
eyes off her since he first caught sight
of her.</p>

<p>Well, this fair stranger is Miss Elizabeth
Drury. You would like to know more? Then,
I can tell you—that the Heritages lately met
with her at Scarborough—where, by-the-bye,
the Degges are yet—that is the reason
you don’t see them here. Miss Elizabeth
Drury is of Yorkshire. Her father is as
eminent an agriculturist as Mr. William Fairfax
is a grocer. Mr. Trant Drury is a great
authority in all agricultural matters, an advanced
man in Georgic science, in knowledge
of stock, implements, and manures. He is a
gentleman by education and capital, but not by
land: and Miss Drury is his only child. I say,
and I am sure George Woodburn thinks her,
a very interesting person. He is delighted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
to see how, after a few desultory and fragmentary
interchanges of speech with longish
pauses between them, his sister Ann and she
warm-up and “cotton” to each other. What?
Yes; they are got upon love of the country,
and of the—Church. Oh, that is enough—the
Church and the country, and George
Herbert’s poetry, and Jeremy Taylor—an odd
mixture, but very taking to both Ann Woodburn
and Elizabeth Drury. There is a great
league struck up at once—a friendship for
life. Ann Woodburn does not perceive that
Dr. Leroy, at her right hand, is spending all
his conversation on Millicent Heritage; and
Miss Drury, though her eyes do wander a
little over the strange company, is deeply
interested in Ann.</p>

<p>“But pray,” she asks of Ann, “who is that
very agreeable young man to the left across
the table, who seems to look one through and
through.”</p>

<p>“Ah! that is my dear brother George!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
says Ann. “You will like him so when you
know him.”</p>

<p>Miss Drury blushed. Why should she?
It must have been because she saw that
George Woodburn had noticed the looks of
herself and sister Ann directed towards him.</p>

<p>Down the table that amiable-looking
Ephraim Wire is deeply indoctrinating a
listening number with Phonetics, Vegetarianism,
and the true source of health—all
topics totally unknown then except to himself.
Further down we hear the voice of
William Fairfax, grown earnest and rather
loud. He is evidently commenting on the
burdens of the poor, and the diseases of the
body politic: and is uttering his favourite
declaration:</p>

<p>“We have three standing armies.”</p>

<p>“Three!” says some one.</p>

<p>“We maintain three standing armies,” he
continues. “We have a standing army of
soldiers to fight the French; and another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
standing army of doctors to fight Death;
and another standing army of parsons to
fight the Devil, of whom he standeth not
in awe!”</p>

<p>“Hear! hear!” Much laughter resounded
from that quarter.</p>

<p>“I hear our friend Fairfax,” said Mr.
Thomas Clavering, “on his favourite topic.
He is brushing our cloth for us; but the
good, dear old reviler, he would give us a
whole wardrobe if we wanted one. For
my part, I like to hear his good-humoured
diatribes, and often look in on him, and am
sure to find some of the classes he denounces,
bankers, officers, doctors, or clergymen there.
There is more originality in that man’s mode
of viewing things than in all the minds in the
county. But mark me, I will take my revenge
on him before he goes.”</p>

<p>With this the guests rose. The tea-table,
at all events, had been a decided
success. The groups who had engaged in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
conversation at table, many of them, continued
to walk and talk together with much
enthusiasm. Mr. Heritage told the company
that he hoped they would contrive to amuse
one another. They would find in different
parts of the grounds, bowls, a target, and
means of archery for those who liked such
exercises, and, he hoped, materials for ample
pleasure in one another. The company
spread, grouped, wandered by degrees in full
talk, and disappeared amongst the winding
walks. The grounds were extensive, delightfully
varied with shrubbery, clumps of
noble trees, lawns opening, here and there,
amongst them, flower-beds; and in one place a
considerable expanse of water, on which were
swans and different kinds of wild ducks; and
seats were placed around for leisurely viewing
them.</p>

<p>Parties of the young men were soon
found, engaged with bows and arrows;
others having a game of bowls; and others,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
and amongst them Thorsby and Dr. Leroy,
trying their skill in jumping. Tom Boddily
had pointed out a soft piece of ground where
they could jump distances without hurting
their legs and feet.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Thorsby, “I hear that you,
Boddily, are a first-rate jumper; let us see
what you can do.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Tom, “it does not become me
to jump with you, gentlemen. I can, it is
true, cut out most of the young villagers at
leaping; but it would be presuming to enter
into your sports, gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” said Thorsby, “I want to see
what you can do. I don’t want to show my
leaping, and have you laughing in your sleeve
at my inferiority.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Tom, “if master sees us, you
will make my excuses.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said both Thorsby and Dr.
Leroy.</p>

<p>Tom having stripped off his coat, led the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
way. The young men were amazed at the
manner in which he seemed to throw himself
through the air, as if he had been an
elastic ball.</p>

<p>“We shall never do that,” said Thorsby,
taking a determined run, and turning very
red in the face, but falling a few inches short
of Tom’s mark. Dr. Leroy, very quietly, and
without much apparent exertion, outwent
Tom considerably; but the next time Tom
flew a foot beyond this. Thorsby put forth all
his strength, but only to find that both he and
Dr. Leroy were hopelessly distanced by this
wiry little fellow. They next tried the cat-gallows,
or high leaping. The result was the
same. “There is no chance with you, Tom,”
said Thorsby; “you must have kangaroo-leather
shoes on.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Tom; “I’ll jump in my bare
feet if you like.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you, Tom,” added Thorsby
and Dr. Leroy together. “And hark! what’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
that? Why, the girls are singing! Singing,
I declare,” said Thorsby, “in the very heart
of Quakerdom.”</p>

<p>They hurried off in the direction of the
sound, and came to where the large handsome
summer-house stood overlooking the
garden-wall. Around it was gathered the
greater part of the company, and a chorus of
voices swelled up from the summer-house,
singing most deliciously, Moore’s “Harp of
Tara.”</p>

<p>“Aha! how’s this?” said Thorsby to
George Woodburn.</p>

<p>“Oh, it is a conspiracy of the girls. I
believe that Yorkshire young lady put them
up to it. She, my sisters, and Miss Heritage,
have got possession of the summer-house and
locked themselves in, and are enjoying the
lark amazingly. And don’t they sing charmingly.”</p>

<p>“It’s grand fun,” said Thorsby; “look,
even the old Friends, who say they don’t like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
music, how they are listening. Look even
at that old Silenus, David Qualm, how he is
drinking it in as he sits under the tree there.
And Mrs. Heritage,—oh, she is smiling quite
forgetfully at this carnal outburst.”</p>

<p>“Whist! whist!” said Mr. Heritage,
equally forgetting his professed aversion to
music.</p>

<p>Thorsby jogged Dr. Leroy’s arm, and
whispered, “Hear that now!—is not that
rich?”</p>

<p>The happy holders of the house sang on—a
number of Moore’s Melodies and Burns’s
Songs, even “Scots wha hae wi’ Wallace bled,”
which was then very popular, and received
loud encores and bravos from the company
below, especially from the Claverings and the
guests “not in the Society” from Castleborough.
Thorsby and Dr. Leroy were as
energetically applausive as the rest of them:
and when Miss Drury put her handsome,
laughing face out of one of the windows, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
said, “May we capitulate honourably?—that
is, to march out with all our arms”—here
the other fair culprits showed a number of
very persuasive arms through the other
windows—“with all our arms,” continued
Miss Drury, “and with colours flying?”
the applause was uproarious; the merry
girls descended in high glee from their
orchestra, and were received with enthusiastic
clappings of hands, and much congratulatory
greeting from all assembled, which
was every soul on the premises.</p>

<p>Scarcely had this lively clatter of tongues
subsided, when another surprise seized on
the guests. From out a walk issuing from
amongst the trees, appeared Mr. Barthe, the
eccentric dentist,—but oh, what a nose! The
young ladies fairly shrieked with affright;
the gentlemen stood for a moment dumbfounded;
on came Mr. Barthe with a nose of
huge size, and with a termination like a
knob of oak. With a most grave and polite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
manner, the Friend bowed right and left
with a grace befitting a courtier, and with
hat in hand, and then passed round behind
the trees. The next moment a loud and
general laugh broke from the gentlemen, and
was joined in by the ladies; but before it
was well over, again Mr. Barthe appeared
whence he had first issued, with another nose
still more astounding. This time it was a
huge very green frog; and with the same
pantomime he passed along and away round
the trees. The wonder and merriment were
in full play, when a third time Mr. Barthe
appeared, now with a yellow-red flaming
beard and head of hair, and a nose—oh!
Bardolph’s was nothing to it for fire and
carbuncle. This time, the surprise having
exhausted itself, the applause was loud and
unrestrained, and the next moment the
Quaker humourist again appearing in his
proper aspect, and with the fiery beard and
scalp and the three noses dangling by strings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
in his hand, was received with great gaiety
by his wondering friends.</p>

<p>“My dear friends,” he said, “don’t imagine
that these are disguises that I amuse myself
with, or of my own invention. They were
the odd fancy of an uncle of mine, a great
woolstapler, well known to many here. As
he rode far and wide through the country,
buying up wool from the farmers in summer,
he used to put on one of these noses, or this
blazing beard and hair, as he approached
some village; the wonder and even terror
that he excited were very amusing to him.
Boys ran crying—‘Oh, look at that man’s
nose! What a nose!’ People looked in
astonishment; but greater was their astonishment
when on returning through the same
village soon after, the boys, seeing him at a
distance, would cry out—‘The man with the
nose!’ and, behold, on his coming up his
nose was just like any other person’s. I am
afraid sometimes he must have occasioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
some boys a beating, or at least a good
snubbing, when they cried—‘Here comes the
man with the nose!’ and the lookers out
saw only a very shapely and befitting nose.
Sometimes the women said—‘Poor gentleman,
what a misfortune! Hush, children,
you may be struck with such a nose if you
mock!’ One woman greatly amused him:
her little daughter was dancing in delight at
the approach of the man with the nose, on
the ash-heap by the door, but the poor
woman seeing only a very respectable gentleman,
with no nasal enormity whatever, gave
the girl a slap, saying—‘Come in, little
minx, I’ll teach thee to be making thy i—o—oms
there on the ash-midden. I’ll give
thee a lection!’”</p>

<p>Such was the story of this strange man,
who in truth very much resembled the portraits
of sentimental and unsentimental Laurence
Sterne; but William Fairfax said
aloud,—“George, thou talks of thy uncle, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
wilt thou take thy affirmation that thou dost
not amuse thyself in thy journeys through
the country with these phantasmagoria?
What says thy man, William Theobald?”</p>

<p>“Ask master himself,” said William; “he
is of age.”</p>

<p>“Well then, George Barthe—what say’st
thou?”</p>

<p>“I say nothing,” replied Barthe, amid a
general laughter.</p>

<p>Thorsby was delighted with the fiery hair
and beard, and would put them on, to the
great sport of the young people. And then
he would insist on some of the young ladies
either putting them on, or trying one of the
noses. At this instant, however, a singular
note, high in a thickly-ivied tree just behind,
caught their ears.</p>

<p>“What is that?” asked a dozen voices.</p>

<p>“It is a note of a nightingale,” said some
one.</p>

<p>“No, that cannot be,” said Mr. Thomas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
Clavering, “the nightingales have long ceased
for this year.”</p>

<p>The sound recommenced and went on. “It
is a thrush,” said Mr. Clavering. “No,—what
is it? It is a thrush, and it is not.”</p>

<p>A loud, clear, warbling again issued from
the ivy aloft in the tree. It was to ordinary
ears a thrush, and a very fine one. But Mr.
Clavering, most intimate with English birds’
notes, said,—“No, it was no thrush; he
believed it to be a man, but an extraordinarily
clever one, and where was he?”</p>

<p>All eyes were strained upwards towards
the part of the tree where its great branches
diverged, and whence the warbling came.
Nothing could be discerned. Suddenly the
air changed. It was a blackbird, with its
fine flowing notes. Again, and it was a
nightingale.</p>

<p>“Ah! that is the nightingale,” said George
Woodburn.</p>

<p>“No,” insisted Mr. Clavering, “but it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
an amazing imitation. Every note correct.
Hark to that—‘jug, jug, jug, more sweet
than all;’ which the printer of Coleridge’s
Poems so provokingly printed ‘more sweet
than ale.’ It is most wonderful!”</p>

<p>But the wonder did not cease, but increased.
From the nightingale’s most impassioned
song, the music, or whistling,
advanced into notes, strange, weird, unearthly,
into a very triumph and intoxication
of wondrous sounds.</p>

<p>“That is surely like the music of birds in
heaven!” exclaimed Miss Heritage.</p>

<p>“What can it be?” continued Mr. Clavering,
going round the tree, and peering up on
all sides. “If I were a lad again, I would be
up in a twink, and find it out.”</p>

<p>One or two youths were throwing off their
coats, to mount the tree, when the droll face
of Tom Boddily peeped out from among the
ivy, between the great diverging arms of
the tree, and said,—“You need not climb,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
gentlemen, it is only me, Tom Boddily!” In
another moment he was seen descending
with the agility of a monkey amongst the ivy,
and down he dropped lightly in the midst
of the company. All crowded eagerly round
him, to learn by what means he made such
sounds. Tom pulled out a simple lark-whistle,
such as village boys use or used, but
without any such magical power. Besides
this little tin box, perforated with a single
hole, he produced also a small tin pipe, not
more than four inches long, and by the aid
of these, he showed them how he executed
such artistic music.</p>

<p>“How in the world did you learn that,
Tom?” asked Mr. Clavering.</p>

<p>“I learnt it when I was sogering, sir.”</p>

<p>“You must have found a very extraordinary
master,” said Sir Emanuel.</p>

<p>“I did, Sir Emanuel; and yet he was but
a poor boy.”</p>

<p>“A poor boy!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, only a poor boy, God bless him,”
said Tom, and the tears stood in his eyes.
“I was acquainted with one of our corporals,
and often used to go to his lodgings—there
was no barracks then—at Ipswich. I often
saw a poor, very pale, but pretty lad sitting
in the court-yard in a light hand-carriage.
He sat there because his mother was a
laundry woman, and could only take him out
when she went with light lots of clean linen
to different houses. To amuse himself he
used to play on a lark-whistle and a little
tin pipe. They were these very ones,” said
Tom, and wiped his sleeve across his eyes.
“I was quite astonished at the music he
could draw out of such simple things, and
delighted to listen to him, and he was delighted
to have me to listen. Poor Freddy!
if he had had his health, he would have
been a great musician. Oh! he had such an
ear! nothing caught it, but he could imitate
it. He picked up tunes, as chickens pick up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
barley-corns, without thinking. And then he
was so fond of reading. He had always some
books lying by him in his waggon—and he
took such a longing, oh! such a longing, to be
out in the fields, to feel the fresh wind on his
poor thin cheek, and to see the brooks running
in the sunshine amongst the flags and
flowers, and to hear the birds. It made my
heart to ache. I knew he had not long to
live; he was lamed by an accident, and the
hurt had taken bad ways. The doctors said
his days were numbered.</p>

<p>“What a shame! I thought, that the poor
lad should so long for the fields, and the
winds, and the look of the sky, and the songs
and ways of birds, and had but a little time
to enjoy ’em, and nobody to take him out.
So I determined to take him, and I used to
go and draw him into the meadows, and
through the woods, whenever I could. And
when my captain was away for some months,
I devoted all my time to take poor Freddy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
out. Oh! it would have done you good to
see what a joy it was to him. How he
would lie and listen by the side of a wood,
and then imitate all sorts of birds, and he
would never be satisfied till he had taught
me to do the same. But I was but a poor
scholar. It is since he is gone that the
power has come to me—by thinking of him,
I reckon. I don’t know how else.</p>

<p>“Poor Freddy! he used sometimes to cut
me to the quick, by taking my hand and
saying, ‘Do you think, Tom, heaven is more
beautiful than this? I don’t think it can.
And do you think we shall feel such cool,
sweet winds, and hear the birds, I wonder?’</p>

<p>“‘No doubt,’ said I, ‘no doubt; they have
everything better and finer than we have:
but, my dear Fred, you are not gone yet. I
hope we shall have many a pleasant time
together yet.’</p>

<p>“‘I hope we shall,’ he would say, and then
lie and think, and then perhaps drop asleep:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
and if ever I see an angel, I know it will
look like that child in his sleep. He did not
live out the summer. That’s how I learnt
to play such bird-tunes.” And Tom went
quickly away towards the house. There was
many a fair face wet with tears—and some
manly ones, too.</p>

<p>“That is an extraordinary fellow,” said
Sir Emanuel. “He is a real genius; and he
has a heart in his bosom, too.”</p>

<p>There was a call to supper. But why
need we follow into that large and well-lighted
room, where an exquisite repast was
laid out. After that, Sir Emanuel, who had
had a fine telescope erected by his own man
on the lawn, showed the young people some
of the marvels of the heavens; and Mr.
Clavering showed others the equal marvels
revealed by a microscope of great powers; and
Dr. Leroy exhibited, by means of a magic
lantern, views of many celebrated cities and
Alpine scenes, which he had visited in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
travels. The Quaker party was a decided
success. All appeared charmed with their
entertainment. Even Mr. Clavering had an
opportunity of taking his good-natured revenge
on Mr. William Fairfax, for as he was
making a sort of harangue, resting his hands
on a chair-back, and saying, of some things
and people that he was commenting upon,
“By their fruits shall ye know them,” Mr.
Clavering said quietly—“But if it should be
winter time, and there be neither fruit nor
leaves on the trees, how should we know
them?” Mr. Fairfax suddenly saying, “Farewell!”
turned round and went off, much to
the amusement of a group of young people,
and followed by Mr. Clavering’s pleasant,
good-natured glance of triumph.</p>

<p>At the early hour of ten o’clock all were
hurrying away from Fair Manor, in the
happiest of moods, and Mrs. Heritage had
not uttered a single syllable of a sermon.</p>

<p class="center">THE PIC-NIC ON THE ISLAND.</p>


<p>The next morning, at breakfast, at Woodburn
Grange, the Friends’ party was the
great topic. All were unanimous in their
expressions of pleasure. “The Heritages,” said
Mr. Woodburn, “seemed to have thought of
everything capable of making the evening
pleasant. And only to think of their bringing
out Sir Emanuel Clavering so!” Tom
Boddily’s music, and his story of the poor
musical child, were commented on with great
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“And, my dear Letty,” said Mr. Woodburn,
“the Quakers, without singing, dancing,
or playing music or games, do know how to
make an amusing party.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span></p>

<p>“Music and games!” said Letty, “why,
we had both.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that improvised vocal concert of
yours was a grand <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup</i>,” said Mr. Woodburn.</p>

<p>“And the noses!” said Letty. “Who
<em>could</em> have suspected that odd Friend of
being an actor!”</p>

<p>“And Miss Heritage,” said George, “did
she take part in your singing?”</p>

<p>“Oh! she denied it,” said Letty. “She
said she only ‘crooned to hersel’’ a little,
as Burns says; but I caught some sweet
tones coming out of that quarter every now
and then. She has a charming voice; <em>that</em>
I discovered; and I believe she knows more
about singing than she wants to be known.
I can tell you one thing—she is a very sweet
poetess. I am promised a delicious little
poem of hers some day, that she repeated
to me. These Quaker girls, do you know,
learn off lots of poetry, and the funniest of all—<em>such</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
poetry!—Moore’s, and Byron’s, and
Burns’s—of all things. They have a poet at
Birmingham; only think, at Birmingham!”</p>

<p>“A gunsmith, of course,” said Mr. Woodburn,
satirically, “as they hate war.”</p>

<p>“No, a banker. What is his name?
Moon—Moon——? something about the
moon.”</p>

<p>“Obadiah Moonshine, I daresay,” said
George.</p>

<p>“Now, don’t, George, drive the name out
of my head,” said Letty. “Oh! there it is—Paul
Moon James. Millicent repeated to me
some verses called ‘The Beacon.’ I did not
think them half so good as her own. But
the Friends think much of them.”</p>

<p>“They are a very extraordinary people,”
said George. “I found those two queer
drab servants, Sylvanus Crook and William
Theobald, exactly alike, only one in little
and the other in large. They were sitting,
and, of all things, discussing Swedenborgianism.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
I learnt that this Theobald, besides
being a Quaker, is a Swedenborgian
preacher, but he takes his Quaker notions
with him into the pulpit. Instead of taking
his text, Thorsby tells us, he says, ‘Here
goes for the starting-place.’</p>

<p>“There was a young, rather conceited fellow,
not eighteen, I should say, trying to
make a little fun out of this old man.</p>

<p>“‘Now, William,’ he said, ‘does Swedenborg
tell you what the soul is?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ said the old man; ‘it is the real
man. This body is but its covering, just as
my coat is the covering of the body.’</p>

<p>“‘Do you expect then to rise, William, just
as you are—asthma, and all?’ The poor
man is often afflicted with asthma.</p>

<p>“‘No,’ said he, ‘there will be delightful
breathing on the heavenly plains.’</p>

<p>“‘But I can’t tell how all these things are
to be,’ said the young, conceited fellow.</p>

<p>“‘How shouldst thou?’ said the old man,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
taking off his cocked hat. ‘Put me the sky
into my hat, Edward.’</p>

<p>“‘Ay, truly,’ said the lad, ‘that would be
a feat.’</p>

<p>“‘Then fetch me all the water of the pond
there in this tumbler,’ offering the pert youth
a tumbler on a little hand-tray, in which he
had been taking water to some one.</p>

<p>“‘Well, it just wouldn’t go in,’ said the
youth, laughing.</p>

<p>“‘How should it?’ said the old Friend.
‘The sky is there, and the water is there,
and the love of God to his creatures is everywhere,
but they can none of them get into
thy little measures, nor into thy little head,
because these are too little for them. The
things are there, but the capacity to receive
them is wanting in them, and in thee, young
man.’”</p>

<p>“That was a very fine answer,” said Ann.
“I like that very much.”</p>

<p>“This William Theobald is the coachman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
of that odd man, Mr. George Barthe, who
went about saying such odd things to the
young people,” said George; “and he gave
us some curious anecdotes of him, for he
attends him to many great houses. At a
great house in Derbyshire, he says, Mr. Barthe
was fastening a lady’s teeth with gold wire,
and as he snipped continually pieces of the
wire off, the lady said, ‘Oh! let a cloth be
spread on the carpet, or the gold will be
lost.’</p>

<p>“‘No,’ said the dentist, ‘it won’t be lost,
any of it.’</p>

<p>“‘But it must be lost,’ insisted the lady.</p>

<p>“‘No,’ added Mr. Barthe, gravely, ‘I
assure thee none of it will be lost. It will
all be found in the bill.’</p>

<p>“The lady smiled, and was silent. At the
same place, Mr. Barthe went into the servants’
hall, and made the servants very merry with
his odd talk. ‘Now,’ said he, ‘why is your
master like a penny loaf on the top of your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
church-steeple?’ They gave it up. ‘Because
he is high-bred.’ The servants were
very merry. ‘But,’ said the dry Quaker, ‘I
know now you are expecting that I should
leave you something. Well, I will leave as
much money as shall last you till I come
again, if you are careful,’ and with that he
fillipped a new halfpenny up to the ceiling,
where it stuck, to the great astonishment
of the servants’ hall. And there it is sticking
yet, says our Swedenborgian coachman, and
is shown to all the people that come to the
house.”</p>

<p>“How <em>could</em> he do it!” said Letty.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said George. “The old
man said he did not know himself, but that
he saw it done, and has seen it since.”</p>

<p>“I had a good deal of talk with that
Mr. Ephraim Wire. Some wag said to me,
‘That is the Castleborough Nebuchadnezzar;
he lives on grass.’ I have heard him termed
an eccentric of the first rank. He certainly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
has some singular ideas, but there is something
in them. In the first place, he wants
a reform in the mode of spelling our words,
which, he says, is barbarous. They ought
to be spelled as they are pronounced. In
the second, he refuses to eat meat on principle.
He thinks it inhuman to kill animals
for food. I bade him recollect that God
expressly gave to Noah, and to all men after
him, all flesh for food, and that our Saviour
eat the paschal lamb. Those, he said, were
Jewish customs, and might do for Jews; but
we were Christians, and called to fulfil the
perfect law of love. I reminded him of the
preying of all animals on each other, from
the greatest to the least, and that therefore
it must be a law of nature, which is a law of
God. ‘We are not mere animals,’ he replied,
‘but men and Christians,’ I reminded him
that he could not fully carry out this system,
that every day he destroyed insects by treading
on them, and myriads of living things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
in water by drinking. ‘That,’ said he, ‘I
cannot help, but I spare pain as far as I
can.’”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Ann, “at least it is very
humane and praiseworthy. And so they call
him Nebuchadnezzar, because he lives on
vegetables.”</p>

<p>“Just so,” added Mr. Woodburn; “but
Mr. Wire goes further. He had a great deal
to say on the mischievous modes of modern
dress, on ladies’ stays, and even on garters.
‘All tight ligatures,’ he says, ‘impede the
circulation of the blood, and injure the constitution.’
He pulled up his loose trowsers,
and showed me that he wore short socks,
and thus avoided the necessity for garters.”</p>

<p>Mr. Woodburn found much wisdom in
what the public of Castleborough then set
down as whims; but we know that Mr.
Wire’s philosophy has now become extensively
adopted. At that day he stood alone in it,
in all its branches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span></p>

<p>This conversation was not terminated when
Miss Heritage and Miss Drury were seen
coming up the front garden in their riding-habits.
They were received with great gladness.
Miss Heritage had lost the appearance
of the Friend, for she wore a black hat with
her dark habit; and both she and her friend
looked fascinating. They were going an early
ride, and wanted the young ladies to join
them. They not only accepted the invitation
joyfully, but George volunteered his company,
and went out to see about the horses.</p>

<p>The whole Woodburn family were charmed
with Miss Drury. There was something so
bright and frank in her manner and intelligent
countenance; her voice had an animating
tone in it. She was, moreover, so much
at home in all the affairs of a farm; though,
unlike Mrs. Woodburn, she did not take any
part in the actual economy of the dairy;
could neither make a cheese nor mould a
pound of butter, her father having had her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
educated exclusively as a lady to preside in a
house, and not to partake in its professional
labours, yet she knew all that belonged to
the whole business of farm-life. She talked
with Mrs. Woodburn of all matters within
and without doors, and could give to
Mr. Woodburn a most perfect idea of the
style and routine of cultivation in the West
Riding of Yorkshire, describe the cereals
which flourished most there, the advantages
of stall feeding, the particular character and
value of stock there. Mr. Woodburn was
delighted, and said he should inflict on her
a walk through his farm one of these days,
and enlighten himself by her opinions. Elizabeth
Drury said she should enjoy such a
walk greatly. All kinds of country life had
attractions for her: even hunting; and she
not unfrequently followed Lord Faversham’s
hounds with her father.</p>

<p>George announced the horses at the door;
and the little cavalcade was soon in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
saddle. Sylvanus Crook, who had been the
two ladies’ groom so far, returned home, and
George Woodburn took charge of the whole
party. It was a beautiful sight to see those
four lovely women and the manly George
Woodburn ascending the road from the
house, and then, breaking into a canter,
disappear beneath the trees at the turn of
the road under the sand-cliffs.</p>

<p>“Nothing like youth, my dear,” said Mr.
Woodburn to his wife, as they turned into
the house.</p>

<p>“Except a happy middle-age, my dear
Leonard,” replied Mrs. Woodburn, “with such
good, happy children, and dear friends about
us. I don’t envy youth, but I love to see
them enjoying their golden days.”</p>

<p>“You are right, mother,” said Mr. Woodburn;
“I sometimes almost tremble when I
think on the long run of blessings that we
have had.”</p>

<p>“Nay, my dear Leonard,” said Mrs. Woodburn,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
“don’t imagine trouble because you
are happy; that’s a shadow out of Mrs.
Heritage’s sermon.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it is,” said Mr. Woodburn; “let us
take a turn down the garden and orchard,
and disperse it by seeing how things are
coming on.”</p>

<p>So the two loving ones wandered slowly
from flower-beds to kitchen-beds of vegetables;
and saw what peas, what beans
wanted gathering; how the raspberries were
getting too ripe; how the wall-fruit was
prospering; and then surveyed the apple,
pear, and plum trees in the ample old
orchard, and decided that the crop would
be abundant and fine. They sate long on a
seat under tall hazels overlooking the country,
and conversed of many things, past and present,
and of events connected with their
neighbours, and the farms that lay around;
and as they slowly wandered back towards
the house, the shadow was gone, and a calm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
and sober joy, like that of the day itself, lay
on their minds.</p>

<p>At noon the young people returned, full of
enjoyment of their ride, and George escorted
the two visitors to Fair Manor gate. All
were eloquent in Miss Drury’s praise: her
fine figure and easy grace on Maydew’s back;
her light and kindly spirit; her admiration
of their country, and familiarity with everything
she saw. Ann loved her more and
more for her love of her church, and of
religion, without its formality. Letty was
delighted with a boating excursion that Miss
Heritage had proposed to-morrow, and tea on
the great island, with only just themselves,
Miss Heritage and Miss Drury.</p>

<p>“And,” said Ann—“Mr. Harry Thorsby;
you did not mean to omit him,
Letty?”</p>

<p>Letty was already half way upstairs, to be
ready for dinner.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of the next day, Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
Heritage and Miss Drury walked down to
Woodburn Grange, and said their boat was
waiting at Wink’s Ferry, with Tom Boddily
and Sylvanus Crook to assist in rowing.
Thorsby was already at the Grange in high
spirits, as usual, and soon the youthful party
were descending through garden and old
orchard to the river. Thorsby and Tom Boddily
were to row Ann and Letty Woodburn,
and George Woodburn, Millicent Heritage
and Elizabeth Drury, aided by Sylvanus.
This was done, for one thing, that Thorsby
and Sylvanus might not get to sparring on
religious points. The day was glorious, the
wind was still, the sunshine lay tranquilly
over the lovely landscape, and the two boats,
with a pleasurable leisureliness, ascended the
fair winding stream, amid much talk and
sprightly “chaffing,” as Thorsby termed it,
from one boat to another. The fields, now
cleared of their hay-crop, were scattered over
with fine herds of cattle, looking peacefulness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>
itself; the trees on the slopes, on their left
hand, as they ascended, seemed to dream in
their slumbrous foliage. Our young girls
came opposite to Cotmanhaye Manor, and
admired its fine situation on its swelling hill,
and the old tower a little in advance on the
steeper ridge. When out of sight of the
house, they moored their boats, and ascended
the steep slope, to get a view from the hill.
Then, having gazed over the extensive scenes
beyond with many expressions of delight,
they beckoned to the boats below, to advance
up the river, and they themselves took a fine
round through woods, and valleys, and past
an old water-mill, half-hidden in its alder-trees.
Here they made prize of a quantity
of white and yellow water-lilies, and conveyed
them to the boat. The descending sun
warned them to return down the river to
their appointed tea at five o’clock, on the
great island under Rockville Grove.</p>

<p>Anon, they were landing there, and Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
Drury was in raptures with that little Fairyland.
On one side, the woods of Rockville
hung darkly down the steep slope, on the
other ran the crystalline river, and the wide
meadows showed greenly beyond. Abundant
willows, mixed with midsummer flowers, made
a soft, verdurous fence round the island. Its
mown surface was like a garden, or park lawn.
Already Betty Trapps was busy there. She
had kindled a fire near the upper end, where
a burnt spot evidenced the fact of former fires
on similar occasions. The tea kettle was
briskly boiling. Under a large oak, a snow-white
cloth was spread, and upon it showed
all apparatus for tea and coffee, with abundance
of bread and butter, plum cake, spiced
cakes, custards, cream, and grapes and
peaches.</p>

<p>Betty and Tom Boddily officiated, and
Sylvanus, as of a soberer age, and a little tired
with his rowing, was invited to join the merry
circle which surrounded the rural feast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
Lively talk and flights of humour alternated
with the emptying and filling of cups.
Thorsby proposed a song, and sung Dibdin’s
“Black-eyed Susan,” Miss Drury delighted
them with the False Knight, “I love and I
ride away.” When some other songs had
followed, and Tom Boddily had given them a
further bird performance on his magic pipes,
“Now,” said Thorsby, “for a riddle. You
don’t know it; for I have just made it.”</p>

<p>“Splendid!” said they all; “now for
it.”</p>

<p>“What is that which lies down, and stands
up, and sails, and flies, at the same time?”</p>

<p>“It is a genuine, bonâ-fide riddle, is it,”
asked George Woodburn, “and no hoax,
Thorsby?”</p>

<p>“Oh! out and out genuine,” said Thorsby.</p>

<p>Nobody could guess it. Thorsby was
delighted, and would not tell it. “No, as it
was bran new, it must not be let out all at
once.” Suddenly he said. “Ah! I’ll ask<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
Tom Boddily, he is as sharp as a needle with
two points.” Tom was at the fire, at some
distance, laying on more sticks. Up jumped
Thorsby. There was a general titter, and
hands held up in merry amazement—he did
not hear or see them. The next moment
Thorsby was at Tom’s side, and propounded
the riddle.</p>

<p>“Did you see that heron?” Tom said,
pointing down the river.</p>

<p>“No, Tom,” said Thorsby. He turned,
gazing in vain down the river.</p>

<p>“But never mind the heron,” said Thorsby;
“the riddle! the riddle!”</p>

<p>“I have it,” said Tom, “it is windmill
sails.”</p>

<p>“Windmill sails!” exclaimed Thorsby.
“How in the world could you guess that?”</p>

<p>“I read it,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“Read it! No, impossible!” exclaimed
Thorsby; “for I only just made it. Read
it! where <em>did</em> you read it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span></p>

<p>“Mr. George knows it,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“Never!” exclaimed Thorsby, running back
to the party, whom, to his wonder, he found
in a full chorus of laughter, and the ladies
clapping their hands in delight.</p>

<p>“What is up?” said Thorsby, wondering
still more; “what is the meaning of it?”
And throwing himself down, he said, “Boddily
says, George, you know my riddle,
and that he himself knows it, and has
read it.”</p>

<p>At this the merriment increased extremely,
and George, taking a page of note-paper from
Thorsby’s back, which he had pinned there,
with the words largely written in pencil,
“<span class="smcap">Windmill Sails</span>,” held it before Thorsby’s
face, amidst the jubilance of the ladies.</p>

<p>“Ha-a-a!” said Thorsby, “now I see!
That’s where Boddily read it. That’s why
he pretended there was a heron, to make me
turn my back towards him. Well, George, I
give you credit for great cleverness; I hope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>
you give me a little for making that
riddle.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it is excellent—first-rate,” said all
together.</p>

<p>“And now I have another idea,” said Thorsby,
suddenly getting up, and fetching the
water-lilies from the boat. Putting these down,
he took Tom Boddily, and soon returned with
an armful of flowers, meadow-sweet, forget-me-nots,
like lapis lazuli; and by the aid of
the ladies, and some strings of osier-bark,
these were woven into garlands, which he
said they would hang up in honour of this
day. When they were finished, however,
here and there interspersed with oak and
hazel-leaves, Thorsby immediately proceeded
to crown the ladies with them. Truly they
looked very beautiful, and Thorsby was complimented
on his taste. George, who had
quietly gone aside, dexterously took off
Letty’s garland, and put her on one of willow,
in pretence that she was forsaken. Thorsby<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
as quietly plucked it off, and replaced it by
one of forget-me-nots, putting the willow on
George’s head amid much mirth.</p>

<p>Betty Trapps, however, was indignant at
the water-lilies, because, she said, they came
out of deep water, which meant trouble; and, as
for forget-me-nots, “It’s all wrong,” she added.</p>

<p>“All wrong!” exclaimed Thorsby. “Why,
forget-me-nots are most poetical and significant.
Everybody likes forget-me-nots.”</p>

<p>“Well, everybody doesn’t, for I don’t,”
said Betty.</p>

<p>“Why, you don’t like true blue, then,
Betty,” said Thorsby.</p>

<p>“True fiddlesticks!” said Betty; “don’t
tell me about true blue.</p>

<div class="blockquot2 fs80">
<span style="margin-left: -.5em;">‘Green’s forsaken,</span><br>
Blue’s forsworn,<br>
Pink’s the colour as should be worn,<br>
Blue and yellow<br>
The lads will follow,<br>
Green and blue<br>
Will never prove true,’<br>
</div>

<p>and you’ve got both in these garlands.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span></p>

<p>“Why, that is a new philosophy,” said
Thorsby.</p>

<p>“New philosophy it may be,” said Betty,
“but it’s old truth; old as my great-grandmother,
and older, I’ll be bound. It is true
as Scripture, for it comes down from our old
auncetters, and has proved its-sen true, or it
wouldna have lasted till now.”</p>

<p>Betty then began gathering the tea-tackle,
as she called it, together, and sung to herself—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">
<span style="margin-left: -.5em;">“How hard is my fate, once I freedah enjied,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Andars happy as happy could be;</span><br>
I was seized by the forces their fires to feed,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And captain for loss of the sea.”</span><br>
</div>

<p>“What is the meaning of that, Betty?”
asked Thorsby.</p>

<p>“Meaning? It’s a song my mother used
to sing,” said Betty, going on with her
picking up cups and saucers, and giving them
to Boddily to stow away in a basket, “to us
children to get us to sleep, and I’ve cried my
eyes out many a time, and gone to sleep sobbing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
and dost think I don’t know th’ meaning
on’t? Oh, it’s very cutting, is that owd
song.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Thorsby, “I have heard
something like it, which I do understand;”
and he sang—</p>

<p class="blockquot fs80">
<span style="margin-left: -1.5em;">“How hard is my fate, once I freedom enjoyed,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And was happy as happy could be;</span><br>
I was seized by the foes their fiat to feel,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And was captive, alas! on the sea.”</span><br>
</p>

<p>“Oh, get out,” said Betty; “that’s the
way such shallow pates takes the life out of
things. Dost think I should iver have cried
over such stuff as that? Why, that is as flat
as ditch-water; there’s nothing cutting in it.
Oh! but th’ owd song <em>is</em> cutting! It goes
to the quick; it goes through bone and
marrow. It makes cowd water seem to run
down my back when I sing it sometimes o’er
my house-work.”</p>

<p>Thorsby laughed, and Betty cast a most
disdainful look at him.</p>

<p>“Here’s a man, now,” she said, “who goes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>
walking with a stick and a dog, like a gentleman,
and knows no better nor that! But
I’ll fit thee, young man, I will!”</p>

<p>And here we may antedate our story to
say that Betty did not forget to do it. The
next morning when the family came downstairs
at Woodburn Grange, where Thorsby
stayed all night, they were all edified by seeing
pinned up conspicuously on the staircase
a memorandum of his which Betty had found—“To
remember not to forget to send my
trousers to be mended, ditto, boots.” Thorsby
came the last of all into the breakfast-room,
looking very hot, but when the next person
went upstairs, the memorandum had disappeared.</p>

<p>As our jovial party of islanders were sitting,
the ladies in their garlands, suddenly a boat
was perceived coming down under the side
of the island; presently it moored, and two
gentlemen ascended the bank, and approached
the ladies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span></p>

<p>“Dr. Leroy,” said several voices; “and,”
added George Woodburn, “as I live, Henry
Clavering!”</p>

<p>He rushed forward to meet Mr. Clavering,
and there was a most affectionate handshaking.
Letty and Millicent Heritage also
ran forward to joyously welcome the son of Sir
Emanuel, who had been two years abroad.
Ann Woodburn advanced more sedately but
cordially, and, with a somewhat flushed countenance,
welcomed their young friend, introducing
Miss Drury to him.</p>

<p>“Why, when did you arrive, Clavering?”
asked George Woodburn.</p>

<p>“Only yesterday,” he replied; “but I
happened to meet Dr. Leroy in Castleborough,
and he was kind enough to come up to-day
and tell me of your water-frolic, and here
we are.”</p>

<p>“A thousand welcomes,” said George, looking
very happy, and so said the ladies. A
great many questions and answers from both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
sides passed, and Thorsby, springing up,
said, “Well, now I declare, that was prophetic.
I thought these garlands were only
a sportive freak, but they were in honour
of Mr. Clavering’s return, and they shall
be suspended from the branches of this
oak.”</p>

<p>“A bright idea,” said all the company;
and all were up and very busy suspending
the garlands from the boughs of the spreading
tree. Henry Clavering thanked them
for the compliment, and the party set out to
return home. The boats were sent up the
river with Tom Boddily, Sylvanus, and Betty,
having first put on shore the young people,
who walked through the woods and lanes in
abundance of interesting talk. Supper awaited
them, and a joyous welcome for Mr. Clavering
from Mr. and Mrs. Woodburn. As the gentlemen
took their leave at night, Miss Drury
whispered to Ann Woodburn, “I like this
Mr. Clavering. He is so thoroughly a gentleman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
and, I am sure, so good and
sensible.”</p>

<p>“True,” said Ann, “but, like us all, not
without a fault.”</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few

Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
